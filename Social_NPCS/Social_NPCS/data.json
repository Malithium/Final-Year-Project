And when I pressed it, it gave me two different Smart TV's to cast to. I had a huge evil grin on my face. \n\nSo first, I immediately searched a Rick Rolled video and casted it to one of the TV's.  I thought this was hilarious, but I wanted to be more clever.

I guess they finally figured out how to turn it off. \n\nSo the next day, I came home from work and checked my mail.

To combat the mouse plague, the farmers cut down the crop, leaving only ditches and field borders as shelter for a huge population.\n\nSo basically, that summer, every kid who could went out with sticks and shovels and pocketknives and BB guns, slaughtering mice with ease. You couldn't take two steps in a ditch without startling a mouse, and I can recall hours upon hours spent on my hands and knees, killing literally hundreds of mice with a garden trowel.\n\nTowards the end of the season, when about a tenth of the mice had been killed, my two younger siblings and I took a 5 gallon pail out to the killing fields and tried to fill it. Took us about two hours to get it a third full; because we could just toss them in the pail, we weren't even making sure they were dead, so the top few layers of mice were just swirling around.\n\nWe took the pail home, saying that we would keep the living ones as pets, but of course we knew that Mom would never tolerate it. We stopped by the pond to rest, and decided that we'd just fill the pail with water and see who survived the longest; the winners would be the strongest, most worthy pets. \n\nThere were no winners.",

                    "body": "This is kinda fucked up and back fired on me a bit... but oh well.\n\nI was probably about 8 or 9 and had a lab/german shepherd mix named Bear (how original). I loved the dog, I was absolutely attached, and he followed me around everywhere. We kept him on a chain about 40 yards from the house, at night or when my parents weren't home. Our neighbors also had a kid named Nick who was around 12-13 years old who was kind of a dick. I played with him somewhat often because I was an only child and him and his friend PJ were the only 2 kids nearby and I didn't have many choices, I lived in a rough home and just needed to not be at the house sometimes, however both Nick and PJ bullied me and would also beat Bear when he was on the chain out back. One time when we were out playing they started to fuck with with him and I didn't do anything because I was worried they would turn on me. I stood there as they stomped on his chain to keep him from running and they threw sticks and rocks at him. He'd yelp, try and get away, but he never attacked. I felt sick to my stomach and cowardly, but oh well I guess. \n\nIt's probably a week or so later I hadn't seen Nick since and I'm out back with Bear. Bear was still on the chain and I was playing with him, I think I had just gotten home from school, and I see Nick wandering over from his place and Bear does too... he stops playing with me and stares over in Nick's direction and starts growling real low. As Nick approaches, I grab Bear's leash and go to take him off the chain and switch him to the leash... \n\n*And honestly I don't really know what I was thinking here. I don't know if I wanted Bear to hurt him or if I thought I could control him and scare Nick away, I know I didn't want him around me anymore, but I guess I wanted \"something\" to happen. I don't know.*\n\nAnyways, as Nick get's within 10 ft or so he can now hear Bear growling, and he says something like. \"Woe! What's wrong with him?!\" But as soon as I unlatch the hook on the chain and move it to the leash, he lunges on top of Nick immediately taking him to the ground. Bear goes rabid and sinks his teeth in Nick's upper thigh and latched on hard. I screamed and struggled to pull him off, I eventually did but at that point Nick's father is sprinting from his house. I switched Bear back to the chain as his dad approaches and in almost complete disregard for his kid, he goes straight for the dog, grabbing a nearby 10 ft aluminum pipe. He swung down hard trying to hit him several times but I don't think he ever connected before my step-dad came out and confronted him.\n\nI don't remember much about the confrontation, it didn't get aggressive, but in the end Animal Control was called... Bear hadn't done a terrible amount of damage as the only real wounds were the 4 canine teeth which had pierced through his jeans. The top two teeth had pierced really deep though and had come close to an artery. So Animal Control demanded Bear was put down. \n\nI blamed myself, never told my parents what I had done, but I still think Nick got what he deserved and Bear was only defending himself. Nick was an asshole and he deserved a lot more than a few dog bites, I'd probably punch him in the face today if I saw him. \n\nTL;DR: Neighbor beats my dog and bullies me. I let Bear of the chain and he tears into the kid. Dog gets put down. I live with guilt. Fuck Nick.\n\nEDIT: Actually... I'd probably bite Nick. For old times sake. \n",

She got about 5 of us and instantly blamed me. This absolutely infuriated me as I didn't actually do this, so i got fucking mad.\n\nLater on that day we had another teacher, and i asked could I go to the bathroom. Whilst I was walking there I noticed no one was in the teachers room, and walked in.\n\nI picked up her laptop and smashed it against the wall until it was in pieces, I spat on her jacket and all over her desk, pissed all over the walls, and carved \"FUCK YOU\" in the wall. I walked out like I did nothing.\n\nThen as we were leaving school, me and my friend pelted her with the apples that she was giving out and ran away.\n\nThe funniest thing about this was that she never even did anything about it, I've never seen her since then and I'm 18 now.  \n\nEdit: whoa this blew up, thanks guys!",

Then out of nowhere, she made this weird gaggy face and kind of dry heaved, like if one of those bald cats somehow got a hairball.  But instead of a hairball, she yorked out a pink metal hair clip. It was one of those big clicky ones that always give the kid a headache when you snap them on. Somehow the 2yo stuffed the whole thing down her pie hole without hurting her or making her cry at all. Maybe she got her to eat it voluntarily?  Who knows.  But she never made a peep. It was just the quiet that tipped me off.  ",

Anyway, he was looking at my cards on the bus and we came to his stop. As he was getting off I thumbed through my stack and noticed it was missing. I jumped off at his stop and the card was sitting in water with the same pin hole that was on my card and he tried to deny it when I confronted him.\n\nThis same kid stole my other friends Egyptian god cards which I got blamed for until he showed me them and I told my friend he had them. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin was when he stole my Pokemon Sapphire. I taught I lot it somewhere in the house until him and his mom showed up to our door and she made him apologize while balling his eyes out. The game no longer worked because he had opened the cartridge trying to \"clean it\", probably used water. I had to beg my grandma for that game and the little shit ruined everything I had done.

Yeah, this would work.\n\nI looked my dad square in the eye and said, \"Maybe Danny did it.\"\n\nHe laughed so hard and congratulated me on not technically saying a lie.

Also the fun you could have doing it to other people.\n\nSo, my birthday was coming up and god dammit I wanted to know what I was getting! Phone rang and it's my aunt, looking for my mum. I yelled out, she picked up the other line and told me to hang up.. instead I clicked the receiver down making it *sound* like I'd hung up and kept on listening, hoping to hear what I was going to get.\n\nWell, I did. Heard them talk about my birthday and that I was getting the game I'd been desperately after for months.. exactly what I wanted. I also got to hear my mum say how she couldn't wait to see my face when I opened it, plus a few other surprises she'd thought up for me.\n\nI was crushed. Yeah I wanted to know, but I suddenly realised that I'd just robbed myself of another few days of wondering, dreaming and hoping. Not to mention the uncontrollable excitement of the day and the elation that comes from getting to open up the present and see what I got.\n\nI'd also ruined all my mums hard work and efforts to make a really nice birthday surprise for me, all because I was an impatient little shit that couldn't wait a few more days.\n\nAnyway, I sucked it up, said nothing and acted my ungrateful little heart out so that I didn't ruin it for my mum as well. But that was they last time I went sneaking around for presents, that's for sure.",

When my mom came home that day I covered my eye and went crying to her that my dad hit me. Given that he was drinking fairly heavily at the time and has a history of being a violent drunk, she of course believed me until she took my hand away and saw how pale and shimmery this black eye was. She also then remembered that my dad wasn't even home as he was down in Florida visiting his parents. I got in some...pretty severe trouble for that one.",

Not that I'm not a Muslim, but u hated praying because it's was just annoying doing it so many times. So when my parents would tell me to pray I had a little formula in my head. So for each rahkat (you know in the movies when they show Muslims going down to the ground and then stand back up. Well every time you go down to the ground, everything you did while standing up to the point of you touch your face to the ground is considered one rahkat) in a prayer I would add that and one minute to how long my prayer should be. So for example the night prayer (last one of the day) is 9 rahkat, so I'd take about 10 minutes to pray it. But in reality I had a small tv under my bed and I'd watch a dvd while I'd tell my parents that I was praying in my room with the door locked. So much effort and wasted time. When I could've just prayed. (I eventually got caught when my mom hid in my closet while I did ablution in the bathroom and saw me go under my bed after I came to my room).  ",

I'm sorry you feel like this is unfair, but that's just the way it is sometimes.\"  Well, having received the standard response, I decided to do something about it this time.\n\nI grabbed a yellow highlighter (God would write in gold, but gold crayon would look like a little kid did it, highlighter was much more Godly), asked my older brother how to do a capital G in cursive (I could do the lower case O and D myself, but cursive capital G's are confusing) and had him repeat it a few times, and then asked him how to spell sincerely.\n\n> To whom it may concern,\n> \n> Life will always be fair through bestem's eyes.\n> \n> Sincerely,\n> God\n\nAbout 30 minutes later I was finally done.  I went back to where she was working on laundry and presented her with the note.  I claimed that my dad had hidden it from her, or that God had forgotten it and was happy to provide me with one now that I brought it up to his attention, or some other nonsense like that.\n\nLooking back now, I don't even know how I thought it would work.  I found the note, years later, when clearing out the closet after my mom died, and it was written on a piece of paper from my brothers or my school notebook (you could see indentations from a pen or pencil from pages above it at some point), the highlighter was hard to read and barely visible (because highlighter does that), and obviously it was utterly reactionary rather than bringing it out the next time life wasn't fair.  As a kid I didn't realize how hard my mom tried not to laugh after reading it, but I do now.   I don't even think I got in trouble for it, although by all rights I should have.",

On the show he gave off a creepy vibe to the point that the woman who \"won\" a date with him decided not to go through with the date because she found him too creepy.  This was a wise choice on her part, because Rodney Alcala turned out to be not only a convicted rapist and registered sex offender but was eventually revealed to be a bona fide serial killer.

My parents leaped at the chance to enroll me there, given that I had previously been attending class at a place over a half an hour away. (It had also been a Catholic school, and the principal hadn't approved of my at-times-sacrilegious shenanigans.) Although construction on the campus wasn't *entirely* finished yet, I figured that the year would pass like any other, and that the only interesting events would be the ones that I personally perpetrated.\n\nThat impression changed when the music teacher informed me that three lucky students would be given the honor of singing a solo at the school's dedication.\n\nSee, the school had been named after a local legend of sorts, about the first balloon to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. There was a song associated with the story - \"The Ballad of the Double Eagle\" - that had two verses, the second of which would be half spoken, half sung by whichever kids were deemed to be the best performers. I auditioned, got selected, and prepared myself for the most important performance of my short lifetime, all the while delighting in the fact that the ribbon-cutting ceremony would be televised on a live news broadcast.\n\nOn the evening of the event, I showed up with a spring in my step... only to be pulled aside by the woman who had been coaching me.\n\n\"Hey, Max,\" she said, \"you know that part of the song that you speak?\"\n\n\"Of course I do!\" I confidently replied. \"I've had it memorized for *weeks!*\"\n\nThe woman nodded. \"That's great. Instead of speaking it, just sing it. You know? Just sing it.\"\n\nI nodded slowly, trying to hide my apprehension. It *should have* been an easy enough task. After all, the melody was identical to the first section of the song, and I already knew that part like the back of my hand. My one fear was that my throat's muscle memory would kick in, and that I'd hear myself offering a spoken word rendition of the song before I could remind myself to do otherwise.\n\nAs it turned out, the end result was much worse than that.\n\nNo matter how long I live, I doubt if I'll forget my first few moments on that stage. I can remember walking out, taking hold of the microphone... and then *squawking* like some kind of especially deranged seabird. I managed to recover well enough, and I made it through the rest of my solo without messing anything else up, but the damage had already been done: Hundreds of people in the audience had seen me literally choke during my first-ever televised performance, and my blushing face was broadcast to countless more people across the city.\n\nIt certainly wasn't the most newsworthy event... but the local anchor still felt the need to call it \"a breathtaking performance.\"\n\n**TL;DR: I accidentally offered my best seagull impression on live television.**\n\n**Edit:** There is a small chance that a recording of my squeaky honk is buried in a box at my mother's house. If she can find it, I'll be sure to upload my embarrassment to YouTube for everyone to see. She's going to check likely locations tomorrow, so it might be a bit... but if it's as bad as I remember it being, it will be worth the wait.",

If she was my daughter I'd admit she was hot and the greatest woman on the planet as well, he's proud of her and he doesn't pretend to be blind. \n\n>As if fathers that blush and get all huffy when their hot daughters are talked about don't think the same thing Trump does, they are just afraid to be honest and agree with people that their daughters are 10's.\ufeff\n\nI mean, the fact that anyone tries to justify it is nuts.",

Long response.\n\nI had a prolonged emotional affair with an abusive girlfriend's best friend over the last year of our four-year relationship. I reached out to the best friend, G, when the torment had become too much. G began to visit more, trying to calm my girlfriend, M, and quickly recognized that M's refusal to take psychiatric medications was causing havoc. G and I became close. We spoke daily. After five months, it became a physical affair as well.\n\nG had just gotten over a cancer scare which had taken her out of town, and needed to find a place in the city again. She moved in with M and I. We had the affair right under M's nose, under the ruse that we had become the closest of friends. It was tremendously awkward, and she left town after deciding that something had to give.\n\nI broke the relationship off with M after 4 years, finally freeing myself from the abuse. G came back. The three of us lived together as G and I sought out somewhere to live \"as friends\". G and I were madly in love by this point. And then her cancer came back with a vengeance.\n\nG and I went to chemo appointments every three weeks and searched for housing when she could handle it. M became very angry (again) that no housing progress was happening. I moved out with family in order to assuage the situation. But then we found the perfect place. The home of our dreams. And G asked me if I wanted to marry her. We picked out rings. 3 weeks passed.\n\nAs we got ready to sign for the place, G realized that she was going to have to come clean with her best friend about us. And then our argument -- our only argument -- started. She vented some anger at me, and I asked if it might be caused by the chemo she had received 4 days previous. She accused me of gaslighting her. She closed off emotionally. I spent a month trying to convince her to listen. She wouldn't. She stayed living with M, never telling her about us. I moved away.\n\nThis was seven months ago.\n\nYesterday, G died.\n\nI'm going to have to go to my ex-fiancee's funeral and encounter my abusive ex, who likely still has no idea that G and I were engaged. And none of G's family likely knows, either. Though once they start going through her belongings, I'm sure it'll come out.\n\nSo my next few days are going to be interesting. How do I feel about G? I love her. I always did. I always will. She's gone, but the memory will last, and the pain of it right now is excruciating. How do I feel about M? Scared. But ask me again in a few days.\n\n**TL;DR: Don't fall in love with your girlfriend's best friend, but if you do, don't ever let her go.**\n\n",

Was an emotional wreck and he had been sober over a decade, owned property, seemed to have his shit together. He told me he'd keep me safe from all the lecherous 13-steppers. I was still high and believed him. \n\n\nGot sober, we texted constantly about anything and everything. He came over and said he shouldn't go near me because I was a newcomer, then immediately jumped on me. Asked to shower after, and the next day admitted he was engaged. I was horrified but lacked the self-respect to put an end to it (no excuses - my behavior was wrong.)\n\n\nIt continued for months while he told me he was being railroaded by the girl and his family but was going to cut things off. He loved me. He'd never loved anyone like he loved me. \n\n\nI start to find self-worth outside of him and cut it off, start seeing someone else. He flips the fuck out and supposedly checks into a mental institution. Shows up at my work and begs me for another chance. He tells me the wedding is off and she has moved out. He wants to be with me forever and have kids with me. Only nobody can know we're together because he doesn't want me to look like a homewrecker and his \"public\" (non)job requires that nobody know details about his personal life. We have amazing weekends away and pretend we barely know each other in front of everyone we know. Ex drunkenly calls him repeatedly and while I'm there laying in bed with him he tells her no, we're not together. Also he doesn't ever kiss me and says it's not his thing.\n\n\nIt gets old. I hear rumors about him and other women and have no reason to trust him. I break it off after a year and he goes on a vendetta against me and the next person I date, but nobody takes him seriously. Last time I saw him he tried to kiss me in front of a woman who recently ran for President to prove he really loved me. I'm still with that next guy (who is amazing) and last I heard the dude found another newcomer and they are madly in love, as evidenced by now-permitted social media selfies. Everyone deserves to be happy and is capable of change so I hope it's true. I'd be really surprised if so, though. \n\n\nTL;DR: Don't be the side chick. Everyone involved deserves better. Also don't shit where you eat, and steer clear of politics. ",

I don't regret the monetary aspect, and realistically, I know if it wasn't me, he would've been with someone else (he'd been cheating for their entire 30 year relationship), but I was pretty convinced if I ever got married, karma was going to bite me in the ass. I felt slightly better when they started swinging a couple years in, I guess. At least she was getting it how and where she wanted.\n\nI stopped seeing him when I met my now-ex husband, but I still miss him sometimes. The sex was amazing, but he also taught me some useful shit. He looked over my retirement investments and made some changes and I've made money every quarter since, so there's that.

I met a man he was a mechanic who was working on my car, he was attractive  and he made it clear he was attracted to me by some serious flirting, he gave me his number in case I needed him to work on my car  again, it was a late 90s saab that had been used and abused and it had a lot of issues so he had been working on it frequently.  One day after a volatile fight with my boyfriend I texted the mechanic and told him we should meet sometime for drinks or dinner, he told me he had a girlfriend  of 10 years and he didn't want me to view him that way, I was floored. If you overheard our conversations  when I picked up or dropped off the car you could literally hear the desire in our voices, I told him I understood. But the next time my car broke down and it was towed to him, we started talking about the car initially  but it led into texting  and talking  all day for a month. After the first month we began meeting up before work for 30 minutes to an hour, just talking. His 10 year relationship  was horrible as well, he had been cheated on by her numerous times, once even having a coworker leave her panties on his toolbox with a note confessing an affair. We had a lot in common, and an attraction to each other i can't really describe, maybe magnetic..we just literally could not stay away from each other. Enter month 2, one morning he grabs me and kisses me for just a few seconds, it left me dazed almost and I knew I wanted him. By the end of month  2 we went to a hotel room and had passionate  sex until literally, the sunrise. it was beautiful , I went home covered in hickeys, sex hair and ready to confess my affair and end my relationship to be with the other man. My ex walked right by me and never questioned, I was invisible to him, I paid 100% of the bills, he was a party boy with serious issues that he punished me for. I was regularly  called fat, ugly, a whore for initiating sex if he didn't want it, etx. He became  violent often and if I threatened  to leave would hurt himself, he slit his wrist in front of me once after telling me I needed to try and ' look better for me, you don't even try anymore' after working a 12 hour shift. I felt like a prisoner and it took the affection of another man and his compliments to build me up enough to leave. I never told him about  the mechanic, I cited 6 years of abuse and neglect for my reason for leaving, I moved out 10 days after the hotel night. I'm now married  with two kids to the mechanic, we're crazy in love and can't keep our hands off each other, he's more than one ever could've wished  for in a partner, he treats me like a queen. We also apparently grew up down the street from each other and our parents were friends I have pictures as a infant in his grandparents  house, all unbeknownst to us until we had already left to be together . I was at his father's funeral as a child, he remembers  me there as a baby with my mom even though he was a child.",

I simply tried doing away with it solo but something always seemed to be missing. Now my best friend, a girl with her own SO, and I are very liberal when we speak, almost having no boundaries on what's taboo and what isn't so I spoke to her about my issue. She suggested that perhaps she could help me with that. I wasn't sure what she meant until it became VERY clear what she meant. Needless to say, in the spirits of good friendship, I let her help me out, and in turn I was helping her since her SO was being a little neglectful in that area. This went on for a while until I felt incredibly guilty about the whole thing, and told her that we should stop. She respected my decision and it ended there. As to how I feel about this? My SO is gone and already seeing someone else so I'm not really feeling all too bad about it. We weren't clicking quite right in the end. \n\nEdit: I have made mistakes commenting down below trying to answer questions.

We met in law school and bonded because we have a lot in common, and our personalities mesh really well together. She was engaged when she started school, but called it off because things didn't feel right to her. As we start talking more and more, the feelings start developing (on my end), she gets back together with her boyfriend (not engaged, just dating), and I try to put her out of my mind. Me trying to put her out of my mind doesn't work whatsoever, and even though our friendship gets stronger and stronger, so do my feelings. Things came to a head when I was moving across the country for school, and at the time, she thought I was going to be gone forever. She helped me move, and on the day I moved in, I finally confessed to her how I felt. \n\nNothing happened that day as we were quite emotional, and there was a third person that went with us, so it's not like we had the place to ourselves. After she leaves, we begin texting even more than normal. Things begin romantically, develop sexually, and I fly back into town for a weekend, and we have a tryst at a nice hotel for a couple of nights. I don't think I've ever felt happier than I did that weekend. \n\nBut after that, I notice things began to change. We still talked every day, but the spark felt as if it had disappeared somewhat, and I felt her pulling away. Almost two months later, I get a call from her telling me that her boyfriend proposed to her again, and she enthusiastically accepted. I cried for days, not only because I thought there was a real chance of us being together, but because it seemed so easy for her to cast aside what we had in favor of her fianc\u00e9. \n\nHe never found out anything, nor did he suspect anything either. We're still friends. Hell, she got engaged less than a month ago, and so things still feel kind of raw. We don't every day anymore, but she's still my best friend. Despite me going through a low period in my life, she does truly care about my well-being, and I've started seeing a therapist to work through some other things that came up as a result of all of this. One day, I'll wake up, and she won't be the first person I think about, but that will take time. I think having her in my life will bring about good change in the long-term.",

One day a new buser was hired, and she was the girl of my dreams with red hair and deep brown eyes and although she barely spoke English, we started talking. I took every chance I could to speak with her,  she had a calming presence whenever I was around her. I'm not very good about asking girls on dates. One day I was talking to her about a church that would feed the foreign workers for free and apparently the food was pretty good. She offered to take me there, but she didn't have any free time until the next week since she was working two jobs. I happily accepted the offer and I was walking on cloud nine for the rest of the week.\n\n\nThe day of the date came, and we decided that we should go to the beach instead of the church, which was nice because going to a church on a first date is a little strange. For some reason she was insistent on going to a secluded part of the beach, she didn't tell me why. Anyways, it was pretty nice I got to know some more about her (and see her in a bikini), we had a good time at the beach until a storm started to brew on the horizon. We made a quick escape to a diner on the boardwalk. After we ordered, she looked at me with a pained expression. And said,  \"I have something I have to tell you... I have a fiance\" as she said this, the skies opened up and a torrential downpour started. She confessed to me that she had invited me to the date because after dating this other guy for so long he had begun to neglect her, and since they had come to America, he even hit her a few times. She was far from home in a country where she barely spoke the language, she was scared and lonely. She just wanted to feel wanted and loved again.\n\nObviously I felt very conflicted about this. I paid for the meal, against her protestations and I walked her back as far as she would let me to her house.\n\nI asked her on another date, where it also rained, but we had our first kiss after watching the Exorcism. Things kind of escalated from there, her fiance never found out. But at the end of the summer she needed to go home and I needed to go back to college. I miss her everyday and think about her I think I love her. She's coming back this summer, but I won't be there...",

                    "body": "Ooof. Idk why I'm answering this but here we go:\n\nDuring a very trying period early in our marriage, my husband displayed some abusive tendencies, and then committed a specific abuse act which shattered me. It triggered my PTSD, which, until then I had been dealing with okay, without the use of medications.\n\nAfter it was set off, everything started spiralling. I started dissociating and becoming really fearful and depressed, regressing to the way I felt when I was much younger. I started an emotional affair with my best friend. Despite living on the other side of the world she was my best source as comfort, especially since one of the most controlling things my husband had done in our relationship was move us to an extremely isolated town more than eight hours from where we had lived before getting married and I'd lost touch with a ton of my old friends. \n\nSo the emotional affair continues for a year and my foster/parents, hearing me go on and on about how much I miss said friend (same gender as me btw) and wish I had more control over my own finances (husband was in charge of our joint finances) they decided, as a birthday gift, to buy me the airfare to go see said friend. I went, despite my husband not wanting me to. (Did he know something? I dunno.)\n\nAnyway it was for two weeks. First week we are as we used to be, physically playful and very affectionate. Second week it turned into more and even though I had the sense that this friend was using me for her first gay experience, I went along with it because I felt loved and safer than I did with husband. \n\nGot home, knew it was all fake, wondered wtf I had done, and continued a spiral into the depths of my ptsd. Tried to get help, therapist opened a can of worms and it got WAY WORSE. I was out of my mind, out of control, scared for my life and dissociating every day. I knew something had to give and I was ready to kill myself to make all the hurt and confusion end. I wrote a long letter to my husband telling him why I was going to do it, and before I could give it to him he found out about the affair. Don't know how. I said I'm sorry, you can't ever comprehend how sorry I am, and gave him the letter. I had every intention of leaving the house and driving away forever, finding somewhere to die, but before I could even get in my car he had totally disabled it. \n(He's a mechanic). \n\nSo, worried about how mentally fucked up I was, he takes me to the local hospital and leaves me there. It's a public ward so honestly not much better than a prison. While in there I cut my arms down to the bones but didn't bleed out, just got stitched up and thrown in seclusion. It was hell. I spent about 4-5 months in various hospitals and attempted suicide twice in that time but finally got my shit together. I took a live in job and moved out of my husbands house. Through all of this the \"friend\" remained silent and basically didn't want a damned thing to do with me since I was so ill and fucked in the head and she didn't want to deal with it any more than husband did. \n\nWhen I started this live in job, I threw myself into it whole heartedly and filled the position better than any of my bosses ever expected. I worked hard long days and was rewarded with amazing work trips away, promotions, a lot of trust, and a lot of new friends. I probably saw my husband once a week during this time and we had talked about divorce but once he saw me doing well and that a blood pressure med was helping with my PTSD(amazing!!) he wanted to get back together. I told him we both had a butt-ton of growing up to do before I would ever consider it, and I spent 12 months living away from him and working in that hard, demanding but ultimately very rewarding job. \n\nBy the end of that 12 months I really had the lid put back on my PTSD, was managing a lot better, set some really good goals for the future, was hugely motivated and had lost about 30kg/ 60lbs. \n\nHusband had gone to therapy, mostly dealt with his own issues, and with what I had done, and very tentatively we decided to get back together. It's been 18 months since then and I think we're doing okay. Some rocky ups and downs and me still wanting to die of guilt/shame for cheating and everything that came after and shame over being so mentally unwell but I think we're getting there. \n\n",

It's a horrible and selfish thing to do and I really hope people that are on the verge of doing it read this and do otherwise.\n\nI had a thing with a friend a couple of years back. We met at work and became good friends.  at the time I was going through a rough patch in my life and with my then GF of 7 years. However my relationship was going great and I was convinced I was \"a good guy\" and cheating was something I always though myself of incapable of doing. Yes she was hot and smart but we both had BF/GF and to me it was just a friendship.\n\nFast forward maybe a year and we no longer work together but still keep in touch. One day the conversation drifts towards sexy stuff and we finally accept that we are attracted to each other. At this point my relationship wasn't going so great. Because of some reasons I rather not say me and my GF weren't having good communication, nor as much sex as we used to, we also had a baby girl witch complicated intimacy a lot. I think we where falling out of love. (AGAIN, NOT AN EXCUSE). Later I found out that my GF also was sort of flirting with some guy but nothing else (I believe her). \n\nSo after my friend and I started having more heated conversations eventually we started talking about meeting up to have sex for real. Something I need to say is that my friend is very open about her sexuality and since we had a lot of confidence in me she had entrusted me with all kinds of secrets that probably not even his now husband knows about. I say this only to illustrate how much confidence we had in each other. In a way I think she and I were actually falling for each other.\n\nDue to scheduling and life stuff we didn't have sex at the time. But we kept talking. At this point I would convince myself I wasn't cheating because nothing physical had happened. I now accept that I was cheating emotionally which is worse in many ways. But at the time in my mind I still was a \"good guy\". We kissed maybe a couple of months later and I was elated, I had never kissed anyone else in my life and it made me feel like a player, that night I was a rockstar and I had another hot girl (other than my gf) willing to give herself to me. I could not stop thinking about her.\n\nAt this point my then GF found some old messages between us and it was a shitstorm. We had a huge fight and even talked about splitting. However we had our little girl and financially it would be hard to survive (do not ever use the kids as an excuse to stay together BTW). I realized that despite all the problems and lack of intimacy I still loved my GF, so I apologized and told her nothing else had happened except for 1 kiss (which was true). We worked on us and stayed together. I cut contact with my friend and thought that would be the end.\n\nMaybe 6 months passed and I ran into my friend on the street. To make it short we started talking again with the promise of \"just as friends to support each other\". It didn't last long and after a couple of months we were at it again with sexy messages, pics, etc. As a couple me and my GF were great but we weren't having a lot of sex which made it hard for me. \n\nIt finally happened one day that I was out alone with friends. She called me and told me to go over to her place, so I did and it happened. To be honest it was weird and not at all what I expected. I didn't even came. But I still was proud of myself for finally achieving it after all the years. I wanted more of her. However she didn't and I didn't understood why. She became cold and distant and I became angry at her and myself for falling for her games. She was a hunter and I was the trophy she wanted. I felt used. \n\nI was too much of a coward to tell my gf. If it had happened more often maybe I would have left her. But since it was just that one boring time I decided to keep it to myself. It was a selfish decision but I really love my GF and I don't want to lose her. Years later I found out my friend banged another dude a couple of times (which killed me because to me it meant I was no longer \"special\" to her) and I think she has an ongoing affair ATM (she is married to the guy that she cheated on with me). I asked her once why she didn't want to keep things with me as she did with others and she told me that she was falling hard for me. And she didn't want to leave her BF because of it. In a way I guess it makes sense in some fucked up way. But I'm glad that she did it because it freed me from her shadow and the anger I felt. It also freed me to get my shit together, get sober, and work on my own relationship. That was 4 years ago and I've never cheated in any form again, I'm absolutely in love with my now wife and I want to spend the rest of my life with her and my little girl. I talk to her ever now and then but I have no feelings at all and honestly I get bored sometimes just talking to her. My wife is still convinced we had sex at some point but I've never accepted it because I don't wanna hurt her and destroy the amazing relationship we now have. It kills me inside and I really want to tell her one day in the future. But for now I think I won't. \n\nWhat I learned from all of this is that we all have the capacity to do horrible things if the circumstances present themselves, but we always have a choice to do so or not. I chose wrong and I regret it, but I'll work my ass off to make it right. \n\n",

However, his mom amd sisters told me to not become invested. \n\nAfter a while, we hit a certain spot where he had moved back in with his mom because of finances & I was going back to school full time. Our schedules were not always on the same page. My ex was getting frustrated & upset. \n\nThen I met this guy online unexpectedly. We connected immediately and could text without end. It was a connection I never had with my ex. This guy became my friend and weightlifting coach. After talking for a few months, we planned for us to meet. I drove 7 hours to see him. We hung out, had amazing sex, and trained one on one. I was on this high and afraid it was going to end. \n\nWhat did finally end was my relationship. It did not end right after that. In fact I stayed with my ex for close to another 2 years. I never told my ex how close I was with my coach or what happened on my trip there. I understood why my ex's ex wife left him because his faults were too large for anyone to handle. There is a good person deep down inside him but it is buried under pain, sarcasm, hate, and major anger issues that he is unwilling to work on. I am still close friends with my coach and would not want to change that. He is a mentor & good person to bounce ideas off of. I would be upset if our friendship ended. ",

She goes on to say how he works rotations, only home two weeks at a time, doesn't call her often, and even when he's home he spends more time on WoW than with her.\n\nSo 30 minutes later we were screwing.  I also came back that New Year's Eve to fuck some more. She ended up breaking things off with that guy so we could restart a tentative long-distance relationship, but as for him personally, I have no idea how much he was told.

At the time I was a piece of shit drug dealer and wound up going to county for a few months over a drug charge. While I was in county, one of my \"friends\" had his sister convince my future wife that I was trying to sleep with her ( the sister) along with a couple other girls. So my future wife fucks my friend the entire time I was locked up. Get out of county, and I go home to my wife and kid who was only a few months old who I missed like crazy, find out about wife fucking friend and I just left, completely cut off all contact with future wife. Fast forward 2 years of a fast life with drugs sex and general not giving a fuck about living anymore, but missing my kid like crazy, and I just so happen to get on the same city bus that my wife and kid were on. I haven't seen them in 2 years and I break down and cry, holding my kid while a bus full of strangers clap. \n\nWe decide to try to make it work because I love my future wife still and REALLY love my kid, but I just cant get over what she did to me. Fast forward 4 years and a poverty stricken life, and we've had 1 more kid and one on the way. Im working at a strip club as a bouncer, and I've just been sitting on this pain for years. I felt like a bitch for the longest time for never getting her back, for letting her punk me out like that. One day we had a big fight that I cant remember what it was about, and I go to work. There were a few girls that wanted to get dirty with me at the club I worked at, but a cambodian girl was into me big time. I told myself that I was going to finally do something about the way I feel, and I fucked this girls brains out for 3 months. In her car, at work, at the hotel, and it was angry sex. I was mad at her pussy and mad at my wife for what she did to me and I had pent up anger for all the years I held it in and I just wrecked her. Problem was we were getting really close, she fell for me pretty hard, and I was getting attached as well. Rule one, never date a stripper. Besides that, I just wasnt looking for that. I didn't want to leave my wife or my family, they were everything to me. I just wanted to shake this feeling like my wife punked me and got away with it. So eventually I broke it off with her after breaking it off IN her one more time. I was a new man. Jesus Christ I was a new man. So much depression and anger was lifted off my shoulders it was a new day.\n\nEventually after a big fight I told my wife what I did, she got angry and I told her she had it coming for what she did to me and the many ways it affected my life and manhood, she put her fist through a wall and that was that.\n\nWe are 4 kids deep now and doing pretty good. We are both able to casually talk about our cheating with no anger or emotion, we were able to both successfully move past it, and are a happy family. Still poor though.",

We became good friends and that friendship gave me confidence. I wasn't used to someone listening to me without judgement or belitting me. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little infatuated, it was the first positive attention I had gotten in years, but I never acted on it. My then partner disliked this person and got very jealous. I stopped hanging around them but we still messaged. My partner began telling all our friends they thought I was cheating and started playing the poor cuckholded victim. Alienated me and assassinated my character so I'd feel worthless, unloved, and dependent again. It got to the point where everyone was already saying I was screwing this person and treating me like crap over it so why not? It was a move made out of spite and desperation. I regret using this person like that but I'm pretty positive they knew what was happening. Looking back now they knew the position I was in and was either offering me comfort/a way out or maybe just simply taking advantage. \n\nI don't talk to either now. The affair gave me the confidence to leave my then partner. I quickly realized the nature of the relationship with the affair partner wasn't healthy either(not to mention the guilt) so I ended that rather harshly. I regret how it all went down.

I was a huge nerd in highschool and no girl ever looked my way. I'm not making excuses just kinda giving some back story. As I got older I started filling out and girls started to notice me a lot. My first affair lasted a year and a half. We were both married and she was my boss. We kept that one straight Monday through Friday 8 to 5. We'd drive to a local park and fuck almost every day. She got fired and we drifted apart. Second lasted a few months at a different job. She worked in my department and we'd go to her house and bang almost every day because it was so close. It ended cause she started getting clingy. 3rd at the same job as the second that one lasted about a year. Amazing sex and it went south when she got clingy. 4th was at a different job. I nearly left my wife for her because I loved her. Amazing sex and she loved me deeply. Then I was laying there after we had sex and it just hit me that I couldn't leave my wife for her and I got up and left and never went back. I'd see her at work from time to time but we never said another word. 5th was at same job as the 4th. Lasted about a year and she kept telling me to divorce my wife and marry her. Not gonna happen. 6th was same place as 4 and 5. Got to talking and then sexting and one day at lunch we fucked in my buddies car behind a subway. That was one time only with #6 and never again. 7th was at my current job. She was fresh off a divorce and we became touchy feely. That lasted about 5 months until she got fired. Never talked to her again. 8th is is who I'm banging currently and have been for over a year. She got a divorce in that time and she's wanting me to leave my wife recently. She had an abortion a few months ago and it was mine. Gonna have to cut her off soon I feel. 9th was a few weeks ago became friendly with a customer, she asked me if I wanted to hang out. I obliged and fucked her brains out. Never talked to her again. They all don't know about each other and I've never been caught. I'm embarrassed but I think I have a problem and I don't know how to stop. This is the first I've ever told anyone about this and I know I'm the biggest piece of shit alive.

Thought about divulging the entire thing to her, but she would blame everything on me and stay with him.

I never really kept any of it a secret, and I would flat out tell anybody who actually asked so I'm surprised she hasn't really found out about it.

We would fuck for 3 hours every time I visited her (at her place, because \"my parents are visiting\" or \"the bathroom is broken\" or \"my housemate has his girlfriend over\"). I was very cautious about developing feelings and one day I just went totally dark on her. I think about her, I desire the sex, but to continue would risk what I've already got (which is better even if after a while the sex life becomes less frequent).\n\nI'm super careful about what I do and I'm not going to stop.

My best friend Shawn was a year older and was, what I'd come to learn later on, a very self-serving, manipulative person. Shawn was good friends with a guy named Nate, and just so happened to be dating Nate's sister, Renee. They both went to a different highschool than Shawn and I did, so I didn't know them, but it was summer and I had a car so we all became friends pretty quickly.\n\nNate tells Shawn that he thinks I'm hot. Shawn sees this as an opportunity to set us up so he can see Renee more because we'd \"double date\". Nate and I started talking and essentially dating, but no labels (I later learned he had no intention for anything more than a summer fling, but 16 year old me thought it was the beginning of a relationship). \n\nWe spend the summer cruising around in the car, with one couple in the driver and passenger seat and the other couple in the backseat making out, switching every twenty minutes or so. We would go to the mall, holding hands, engaging in way too much pda. We'd go to Nate and Renee's house, and into their respective rooms and have that crazy, carefree but intense sex that teenagers do. And everything was great. \n\nOne day Shawn, Nate, and I went to pick up Renee from her friend's house after she had slept over. The friend, Jen, came out to talk and seemed to linger too long, asking Nate a bunch of random questions, and she kept glaring at me. After she finally went back inside I asked what that was about, but they all brushed it off saying \"that's just how Jen is.\" Life continued as normal after that until school started back up. \n\nIt was like the flip of a light switch when we started school, we never hung out except on random occaisions and there was no more kissing or hand holding or anything on those occasions. I was devastated, my 16 year old heart was broken. Then a month or so later Nate messaged me on Facebook, just seeing what I was up to, because, \"Jen and I are on a break until she turns 16.\" To which I replied, \"that's weird, I didn't even know you two were together\" he then says. \"Oh yeah, we've been together almost two years now.\"\n\nSo that's how I found out that I had been the girl he cheated on his gf with. And not only that, but Shawn, Renee, and even Shawns mom all knew the entire time and never told me. Hell, they encouraged me to be with Nate. None of them are a part of my adult life, for obvious reasons.",

Mistake 2. Falling in love with one of my misters (male mistress). I told the sailor the truth (after 4 years of marriage wherein I spent a total of 1.5 years in his physical presence) via email (he'd been gone months & the guilt was overwhelming) that I couldn't handle being married to the military, I'm weak & I want him happy.

I took my mister (who I met in a bar, btw!!) back home and married him a year later. I have never fucked another dude since and the mister is my soul mate. The sailor is married with a step-kid on the east coast and looks super happy from random Facebook stalking ! (Side note: I can't have kids, sailor wanted kids, I don't think he can even have kids himself  but his current lady came with a child and he looks like an incredibly happy father which I couldn't give him cuz I prefer pets to kids.) So - best affair ever? ",

I think, for awhile, I was genuinely okay. But I started to notice how flirty he was with other women in his department. I created stories of his affairs with these women in my head until I was drunk, angry and wanting revenge. I revenge-fucked three men during the length of our three year relationship. It somehow never got back to him. All three of these men I'd met through him; one I would later date. \nWe're friends now. It's been 6 years since we split and he still has no idea. Even after I'd moved two hours from home and started dating his old roommate. I later found out that there had been multiple girls he'd slept with while we were together. Which basically justified my actions for me. Speaking up now would only place drama in an otherwise healthy friendship. \nSo, nah, I don't feel bad. I learned what to look out for in future relationships and that you should never ignore gut feelings. I also learned that cheating is a childish response to dealing with problems in your relationship. I wouldn't do it again.  ",

I got the guts to break up with him the next morning. When he asked why, I told him it was a lack of respect, which I guess was true. Probably my most hypocritical moment.

And now I know I just need to work on being more assertive.\n\nFunny how some people fly off the handle when you tell them you can't see them anymore.

They may have a one off event that goes totally under the radar and to the grave, or be in a long term affair that requires stealth and planning.  Problem is, most people are really shit at stealth and planning. In large part, affairs are like speeding.  Most of the people who do it, don't get caught, and there is a direct coorelation to how stupid you drive over time, and the likelyhood you will get busted.  Same for having an affair.  The longer it goes on, the more difficult it can be to maintain.\n\nThat being said, I have had an ongoing affair for about 4 years with one woman, a year with another, and about 3 months with another.  These are all going on consecutively and do not interfere with my relationship.  There are a variety of reasons why this is so, however they would include far to much in the way of personally identifying information, and I choose to be part of the group that is smart about their choices.  My relationship with my wife is actually incredible, and likely better than most relationships in reality.  I know that many couples have these phony Facebook romances where their lives in pictures are grand and amazing, yet in reality are absolute rubbish. I am aware of what a truly shit relationship looks like and how people mask them for the rest of the world.  Studies show the most prominent indicator that a couple is in trouble, is a neverending push to appear perfectly happy externally.  The most common sign your spouse is cheating, is they they accuse you of cheating.  \n\nMy extra relationships are largely sexual, long term, each with its own purpose and reasons.  Again, information beyond the scope of the topic, but I am certain that the answers to this question largely boil down to the individual, and how they perceive the world, themselves in it, and the idea of consequences and benefits.  I look at things from a risk analysis perspective in which I have very low risk and take almost no chances.  I imagine a good number of people are simply impulsive and make mistakes.  Nothing I do is a mistake by definition.  I know exactly what I am doing and what the consequences are.  My relationship with my wife however, could not be better.  ",

Around the five year point in our relationship I realized that we was mentally abusing me. I was very young when we started dating so I didn't associate his behavior with abuse. Needless to say I was scared when I made that discovery but I still loved him and after spending over five years together I felt a need to try and make it work. I never confronted him about it because I was scared he'd manipulate it into being my fault just like everything else that was ever wrong so I just tried to better myself in the relationship. For the next six months I planned vacations and dates and tried my best to do what he always wanted, basically tried to be the perfect girlfriend. Eventually I realized that this was not making me happy. I was sacrificing a lot and saw no change in return. At this point I had been friends for a while with a guy I met online (playing CoD). He and I were both going through a lot at the time due to past or current relationships. We were the only people in each others lives that knew was going on so we started to become very close very fast. Our relationship started to become very emotional. Eventually it progressed from there. Even though it all happened online I felt horrible. Despite what was going on in my relationship he did not deserve it and it was no excuse. After a few more months I finally left him. At the time he didn't know what I had done but he definitely seemed like he suspected it. After two years we reconnected for some closure. He apologized on his own about the abuse he put me through, saying how sorry he was that he had not realized what he was doing. I owned up to cheating and apologized for the way things had ended and how I should have just been more honest with him from the start. We agreed to be friends who catch up every few months.

I was extremely shy and without any self confidence, posted a picture of me in a \"show us your face\" thread and she was nice to me. Some times later, we were exchanging, phoning, and planning to see each other.\n\nAt the time it was like 15 hours a day (yeah) of chat, including 3 or 4 hours on the phone. I started to miss school, etc... She was very attractive and I figured it was unreal.\n\nThings turned to become very hot, but also exhausting. She kept saying she would divorce, meet me etc... For months. We found an arrangement, as I was going to work abroad, she would meet me there. I don't know how I managed to believe that she would do it (coming alone to someone she never saw in real life), but I deeply believed it, I was crazily in love. \n\nI moved abroad, worked, found a very nice appartment, and waited for her. I waited weeks, then realized nothing would happen. She had become distant, etc... She kept telling me her husband was out of the way, living in separate house, planning for divorce etc... \n\nOne day she calls me and say it was over, without a reason apart of \"I will ruin your life if we continue\". I was so lost at that time.\n\nShe disappeared, then came back, saying she loved me more than anyone etc... Then went away again. \n\nSome months later I went back to our country, to finish studying. I will remember a specific day all my life. I had an important exam at 2PM. At 12 she called me, telling me she was pregnant. \n\nThis felt like the end of the world. I fell into a deep depression that took years to overcome. \n\nShe became angry at me. Started to talk bad to me, being really mean, probably to push me away. \n\nI did some research on her. I realized she lied to me about so much things. She kept coming on the forum where we met and I was seeing her posting like she did not even know me.\n\nSome months later, a guy emailed me. He was a guy from this forum. He had a similar story. He did some research on her and I realized she lied about really A LOT of things. \n\nI never talked to anyone close about all the details. I ended up calling lifelines (don't know if this is the word, but phone numbers with people answering and listening), etc...\n\nThe worse thing is, sometimes, I still miss her. The moments we had. It was a crazy period of my life.\n",

Also, hanging out with more middle-aged people, you start to find out how attracted to younger guys a lot of these women are when you get drinking or smoking with them, and they start making all the comments and passes they never would in the workplace setting.\n\nI dunno, I would never want to be somebody's mister...ess...er...? boy mistress, whatever, but a fantasy I've been having recently is having a relationship with some mid-thirties single working mother. Like, between work and raising a kid, she doesn't have much time for meeting men and pursuing a romantic life, so when some young dude pretty much falls into her lap, she's like \"jackpot!\" and is real chuffed that she has convenient access to a... buddy without having to exert much effort and go through the hassle of trying to meet guys between other adult responsibilities.\n\nShe has mostly had her fill of going out, and prefers stay-in dates, watching movies, playing board games, making dinner together, and drinking wine. She's experienced and knows exactly what she likes and has me do it for her, guiding me through it and directing me, and I do what she tells me. And when I wake up the next morning and she's already up getting ready for work, she's like, \"I packed a lunch for you, it's on the kitchen counter!\" I go downstairs and there's a brown paper bag for me, mostly packed with healthy stuff, like apple slices, trail mix, a sandwich, and a juice box, but she also always puts one fun treat in there, like Dunk-a-roos or Fruit by the Foot or Welch's.\n\nAh fuck this is the kind of weird shit I should post under a throwaway but I'm too lazy to sign out so let it just be known that I'm a creep",

I felt like my trust-o-meter was busted so I couldn't even believe others for a long time.\n\nToo much drama. I just plain don't date guys who do any more, even though I think it's so valuable for a man to understand women and have good female influences. \n\nHaving women as friends is a sign a guy is cool and will be more likely to \"get me\"-- he might have greater empathy, and not put women on a weird pedestal, or hold the few women he has in his life inappropriately close. Guys who aren't used to being friends with women often come off as greedy and unintentionally keep a few prospects \"in orbit,\" and that's nothing but stress. Unattractive.\n\nI find it a really good sign when he treats them as well as he does the men in his life, in whatever capacity they have as co-workers or classmates, and equality is ideal... No need to be \"bros\", but if a guy can accept women as people and enjoy mutual things together that's awesome. My male friends are wonderful people and I look forward to our future as friends.\n\nBut a *best* friend? Nah, I'm too busy to suss it out so I just don't. It sucks to feel like a placeholder and heartbreaking that the one you love expects you to change yourself and your boundaries to suit theirs. It always tended to be some shit like this. \n\nEdited for jumbly jumbledness.",

Your husband was abusive, and one thing that lets abusive spouses continue is keeping their spouses isolated so they have no emotional support and place to turn to outside of the abuser, leaving them feeling trapped and without any alternatives. You *did* have an emotional support, which is a very good thing. It's hard for me to think of that as \"emotional cheating\" when the reason emotional support of that extent was even needed was because of abuse. You were probably in a position where you were too scared to leave your husband (so many factors make it incredibly difficult for wives to just up and leave abusive husbands), but also couldn't just swallow his abuse without some outside support. And though that support system kind of morphed into a romantic/sexual relationship, which is cheating, I suppose, it seems less \"wrong\" than somebody having an affair just because they can. Your husband wasn't giving you the care and respect you needed at the time, and somebody else was helping you deal with that, and it just happens to be an unfortunate turn of events that that person and you felt a not-entirely platonic attraction to each other.\n\nI hope things are going better now. I was a little concerned when I read that you guys are still together, because I don't think abusive partners are known to get better and stop abusing. But hey, there are exceptions to everything, so if the \"rocky ups and downs\" you guys are facing are the normal challenges of relationships and have nothing to do with more abuse, and you guys are mostly happy, then I'm happy for you guys.",

I also worry that I may ( I mean there are other factors obviously , not saying he isn't super amazing but there is some shyness and other things ) hinder his ability to find a girlfriend.  I wouldn't blame her really, we tell each other i love you all the time ,  his his parents and sister love me , he is my friend I go see movies with and the one who can pull me out of emotional breakdowns the best , I was his first  ( and still his only ) really close friend and if we grew apart it would destroy me.  Nothing  has ever ever happened between us\nBesides general platonic friendship stuff ( maybe a bit of cuddling , but more me being tipsy and falling asleep on him type of cuddling )  in fact most of my friends ( male and female ) have seen me naked, he hasn't .  We toyed with idea briefly but decided it wouldn't last and we didn't want a breakup to fuck up our friendship and we cherished our friendship more . He is the sweetest person in the entire world and deserves the best nicest girlfriend in the world also . I don't know when it will happen but I'm hoping when it does she can be adult enough to establish boundaries with me early on and discuss her concerns and trust him and me and I can be friends with her as well. \n",

Should things ever turn bad between her and her husband, I'll be there as a friend, but she foreclosed the possibility of us ever having a future the moment she accepted his proposal, and I intend to stick to that. \n\nIf anything, I miss my friendship with her the most. Even before the romance blossomed between us, the connection we had as friends was unlike anything I had ever felt with anyone else. For reasons I'd rather not disclose (which also is why I'm seeing a therapist), I've spent the majority of my life keeping people at arm's length in order to stay emotionally detached. There was something about her, she saw through the smiling, happy face I put on for everyone else, and saw the real me. She's made her choice of who she wants to be with, but neither of us want the other out of our lives. You don't find connections with people like that every day, so when you have them, you don't want to let that go.\n\nAs for the healing aspect, being 1,500 miles away, keeping myself immersed in school, and talking with a therapist and other friends helps tremendously.

Passionate love, and compassionate love.\n\nPassionate love is usually the first 5 years or so, and when everything settles into a comfortable habit, it turns into compassionate love.\n\nThis is when the guy or girl don't bother to make themselves look pretty in front of the other. She no longer wakes up before you do to make sure she looks good for you. He doesn't buy grand displays of affection much anymore.\n\nThis is perfectly normal.... problem is, not a lot of people know about compassionate love. They think when the passion dies down, they've fallen out of love. Then that hot guy/gal passes them, and a spark they haven't felt in a while ignites. Love at first sight! Why am I feeling this, if I'm with my partner? Does this mean I like the new person more?\n\nNo, there's always going to be attraction, even if you have a partner. If this wasn't the case, guys wouldn't secretly check out that girls butt. Girls wouldn't fawn over that popular sex idol.\n\n**EDIT: Disclaimer, the opinions you are about to read are mine and my wife's shared opinions. It is what has worked for her and I. I share it in the hopes it works for you. While I understand you may live a lifestyle in which this may not be suited for you, please understand I mean you no harm. Thank you.**\n\nThe key to a strong relationship is recognizing your partners language. Girls think love is grand displays of affection, or buying flowers and chocolates **even when you're not in trouble!**\n\nGuys think love displays are providing a stable house and caring for the children and her. They expect the girl to seduce them and ravage them when they get home from work.\n\nMy wife once told me something her mom told her. Her mom said, \"If you want to keep your husband, never deny him sex.\"\n\nI questioned her about it, and she explained that a relationship is supposed to be about giving to your partner, not withholding. If you leverage yourself by denying your partner, they'll not feel loved, or wanted. If a guy or girl can't have sex on a regular basis with their partner, they will look for it elsewhere.\n\nMy father told me to never be afraid of saying, \"I love you.\" To always thank her for the little things she does. If she brings me breakfast, \"Thank you dear, this looks lovely.\"\n\nIf she washes my clothes, \"These smell great dear!\"\n\n**HOWEVER, The most important thing I learned, ever, and if you are to skip everything I wrote, just read this one thing.**\n\nI learned that girls want constant reminders of your affection. Buying small gifts or flowers throughout the year has more impact than a large gift at the end of the year.\n\nGuys are the opposite. They like expensive things. Save up for that expensive watch, or Console/PC that they like.\n\nPeople have different \"love languages\" as stated by u/Airoul, so this may not apply to you.\n\nI've said too much.",

I have a bunch of close guy friends including some of my best friends.
