In the West we used to be a lot more open about death and dying and people died at home, so you couldn't avoid talking about it. There were systems in place for mourners, rules of conduct about what to wear and when as well as rules for people who wanted to support those that were mourning. Now people don't want to talk about the subject anymore and the result of this is that people sometimes find themselves in a position of responsibility for a sick or dying relative and have no idea how to help that person. Also now that formal mourning periods have gone out of fashion, nobody really knows how to support the grieving. No one knows what to say or do, and this results in grieving people finding themselves feeling isolated and unsupported because their friends and community avoid them because they are afraid of saying 'the wrong thing'. It seems like we've taken a backwards step on this issue socially. ",

The other brother was taken in on 8 counts of intent to kill police officers. * Witness accounts described it as men setting up for target practice * One of the police officers AK-47's was unauthorized * NOPD had a homicide detective provide a fake witness account, planted firearms, and tried to make it seem like the civilians fired upon the officers. * A former police officer stated at Hills' trial that Hills (one of the officers) had used a racial slur in later describing how he tried to \"pop a round off\" at 14-year-old Leonard Bartholomew. * One of the officers sentence was reduced down to 7 years, the lowest of the four. -all edits go towards fixing typo's/adding more information. -to those messaging me about posting a TIL thread, I tried to when I found out about it.

People change so much over the course of one year that the idea of holding some dumb thing that they said years ago against them (that they probably don't even remember saying) just baffles me. Also, people just seem so eager to expose and take down each other.

Everyone who seems to be fighting for women rights talks about equal pay grade for women, about the need of having equal number of female coworkers, about why more women aren't taking up STEM courses, (all of these are important) but they never talk about the biggest most obvious problem faced by girls: sex trafficking is real, it happens on a very large scale all over the world, everyday little girls are abducted and transported to brothels far away from home where they're practically kept hostage, drugged, and raped several times everyday for years, and get STDs and die at a very young age. The things is, EVERYONE knows where their local brothel is, the police/politicians/activists/journalists, they all know. They also know that's where you'll find the little girls who are forced into prostitution. I mean if you're going to have the young girls having sex, they obviously are in brothels where people visit. But then why is it that I NEVER see that as a prime concern among activists? I mean activists have convinced the governments to do far less important things, so why don't they all come together and get the media attention and force the government to do something about it. For areas where prostitution is illegal, the government can issue a notice that they'll fire police officers if anyone provides evidence about a brothel in their area. For areas where prostitution is legal, we can have compulsory surprise inspections for underage girls by the police; and if even one minor is reported (by any individual like a journalist who performed sting operation), then the police officer in-charge gets fired. There are so many ways in which the activists and media can force the government to force its law enforcement to crack down on illegal brothels and regulate the legal ones. The logic can't get any simpler: Brothels need customers, so if there's a supply of sex at a specific location then obviously many people know about it, and so police knows about it too, and if there are underage girls forced into it, that's where they'll find them. If we can make it difficult for the people involved to keep and sell sex from underage girls, you'll at least see a decrease in the number of abducted girls. I know those people will find other ways, but if we make their operations even a little bit difficult and decrease the abductions even a little bit, I think we'd have saved several lives. It's a good start at least. But why aren't people even taking an initiative? Why is this not a news I read about (unless I explicitly Google it) or a trending topic on social media or the prime agenda of activists? Edit: A typo",

Journalism exploits this--if it's shocking and people will read it, they will publish it, regardless of whether it's scientifically accurate or not. Politicians don't do what is right for public health and the environment, they do what will get them the most votes. It's serious and no one seems to care. As a scientist, I think we are most certainly part of the problem--most people don't even know what a scientific study looks like, let alone where/how to find accurate information. We need to connect more with the public and speak up against the bullshit.",

I probably know of at least 50 people who have died of overdoses in the last decade. At least a quarter of the people I know have had or have a problem with them. People start off buying pills and then move onto heroin because it's cheaper. Gangs are moving their territory into the suburbs and little towns for fucks sake, at least back in the day people had to go to the cities to get it. It's just crazy because nobody really seems to be going after the doctors that keep filling the prescriptions and the police at most go after the middlemen at best that are selling heroin. They need more rehabs, doctors should go back to prescribing the stronger opiates only to like terminal cancer patients like they used to, and the police/government need to crack the fuck down on getting rid of heroin. Edit- A lot of you are replying that nothing should be or could be done, but let me bring you back to the long time ago of the 90's. If you had a pain the doctors would give you something for the pain depending on how bad it was, fix said problem, and then give you more for the short time after and that was it. They weren't handing out Oxys for a bum knee and were more concerned with fixing said knee rather than leaving it shitty and throwing drugs at it. We all lived fine and this might be hard to believe for some of you but opiate addicts were a very very small percentage of the population. I acknowledge that there are some conditions that warrant stronger drugs but honestly most of them don't. People abuse their scripts and then either try to get more or stronger ones. A lot of you are justifying your addictions, I guarantee a lot of you would live just fine with weaker opiates and less of them. And as I've said I know how it goes a lot of people blow right through their scripts and then right after that are buying heroin or they're just flat out selling them to buy dope because it is much cheaper. Weirdly back in the long time ago of the 90's when people had less access to opiates less people were doing them. Who would have thunk?",

It just came down to that we were understaffed and she didn't want to go through the effort of finding coverage for my shift, so she thought she would guilt me into coming into work sick. Well, it bit her in the ass because I quit the next Monday, and did an exit interview with the DM, telling her about how incompetent this manager was. The entire rest of the store quit within 3 months of me leaving because I was the one who did most of the work around the store, so everything I was doing fell on the other supervisor's shoulders, and people were just generally sick of the manager's ineptitude. The store collapsed because she had to hire an entire new staff a month before holidays, and she ended up getting demoted because of how badly she mismanaged the store.

Bringing something up to the counter and being told you can't buy it with food stamps is one of the most humiliating things that has happened to me. The idea that poor people can't take care of themselves is paternalistic and just plain incorrect. There are just as many people who buy horrible food and have untreated diabetes who pay for it themselves, should we be legislating them? This is the kind of thing they talk about on Fox news. Saying that people shouldn't be allowed to buy lobster and steak on food stamps. It's a slippery slope and I certainly disagree. We need to legislate the food lobby, healthcare, and a livable wage before we start legislating poor people's choices. They have few enough choices as it is without taking more away from them.

Those that arent being bleached are being decimated by exploding populations of starfish and parrotfish. Our fisheries are in extremely bad shape, and instead of slowing down, we are ramping up production (looking right at you Japan). You can expect many types of fish to disappear from shelves in the next 10 years. Many of these, like the blue fin tuna, are top predators like sharks; so their disappearance is going to completely fuck up the food chain. Trash islands are growing larger and larger creating more dead zones than ever before. Overharvesting of krill for fish oil is causing a food shortage for whales. Also on the topic of whales is the fact that they cant communicate as well anymore due to interference from the noise of ships. Jellyfish populations have gone crazy, massive swarms are sucking up all the available food in places, leaving many other organisms to starve. Not many creatures eat jellyfish, an exception being sea turtles which are having a hard time as babies get confused if hatched near human civilization and will go towards city lights instead of the ocean thinking they are stars.

While antibiotic resistance is a huge problem there are large movements in the field to find new methods. In the past few years two new classifications of antibiotics were discovered, there's been a rekindled interest in phagetheropy the field I specifically am interested in for research (using viruses that specifically target pathogenic bacteria while not causing harm to the patient), we're also making movements in antibiotic use reform though I know less about that but I know there was talk about issuing fines to doctors misprescribing antibiotics. If people want to help on a personal level: if you have a viral or fungal infection, DON'T demand antibiotics from your doctor it'll do crap for you beyond kill the flora in your body and any opprunistic pathogens that survive can develop new resistances. Take all of the antibiotics prescribed to you even if you're getting better, it ensures that most of the bacteria die and fewer have the chance to develop resistance. And any left over antibiotics leftover for whatever reason take to a pharmacy for disposal. We definitely need to do more, but a lot is happening, people just generally don't hear about it. Edit for clarification: So I define antibiotics as being strictly for bacteria, Antifunals are for fungi, and Antivirals for viruses. If you're doctor prescribed you something for a sickness they most likely gave you the right thing. There are people who demand antibiotics when they don't need them, I know people who try to get antibiotics for the flu. Also stop asking me about whether or not you should be taking specific medicine. I'm just post-undergrad I'm not qualified to answer said questions, and it's not every ethical, though in all likelihood if your doctor prescribed it take it, especially if it is the proper medicine. Edit2: Okay so should have edited this a while ago for this part. I am aware of the issue of antibiotics in the meat industries, it just didn't come to mind when I posted this. Also I didn't mean to attack doctors, several of my posts were telling people to listen to their doctors not some random person on the internet. I mentioned fining because it was something I had read and heard about. I do believe doctors should be responsible with the distribution of antibiotics, but at the same time people should realize if they aren't prescribed then you probably don't need them. Antibiotic resistance is a huge issue cause by a lot of different things and can't just be blamed on single events.",

They asked if I was okay but besides that they left me alone. I think they thought I wanted space, or maybe they felt uncomfortable and didn't want to upset me. Either way, I felt so alone. When I went back to school, none of my teachers said anything to me about it. They knew it happened (small catholic school, so they had been praying for my mom all school year). The only teacher who did mention it basically said I needed to get over it and catch up with school work. They didn't cut me any slack and had me make up everything I missed. I never felt more alone. My whole entire life was altered by the death of my mom, and no one seemed to care. I know my friends cared, but they didn't want to talk to me about. I would have liked if one person just sat down with me and asked me how I was doing, or was there for me when I needed. I will definitely teach my future children that it is okay to talk about death. I hope no one else has to go through what I did, but the reality is people cannot handle those discussions so they shy away from talking about them, even at the expense of their friends or family members suffering.

I was still in college, and I was hoping to become a youth director one day. One of the girls in my youth group found my Facebook, and she read through my posts all the way back to 2 years prior, when I had started a discussion with some friends about where exactly in the Bible it says that premarital sex is wrong. I of course had no idea this was happening, and the girl's mother was an active volunteer in the youth program, so she took it upon herself to organize a Bible study specifically about premarital sex and why it was wrong. To this day, it baffles me that she felt the need to address a Facebook post I had made 2 years prior rather than the fact that her 16-year-old daughter was full-on Facebook stalking a 21-year-old youth worker. I did wind up becoming a youth director for a while at a different church, but now I sell video games and I'm much happier",

I can tell you that no two people that attend the same school get the same experience. Sounds like a no brainier comment, but you'd be surprised how much of their personal experience will then dictate their position on school reform. And this isn't just for the lay person, this includes the people in positions of power that can actually make an impact on this issue. And there is the big problem. When you look at our politicians who write the legislation you shouldn't be surprised to see what schools they attended, what schools their children attend, etc etc. Take our new SOE, Betsy DeVos as an example.

Or the ex-con who can't integrate back into society because she's so used to prison life (which is very unlike civilian life) and finds herself tempted to go back to the life she's accustomed to. The US recidivism rate is ridiculously high. But our culture doesn't give a shit. We're vengeful people. If you do wrong, you deserve all the bad shit that happens to you later, proportional to your crime or not. There are a few people who I find disgusting enough that, while I wouldn't say they *deserve* to be abused, I honestly can't feel any sympathy for them if they are. But most prisoners aren't those people. The majority of people in prison aren't there because they raped children or went on a killing spree. [More people in the US are in prison for drug offenses than anything else.](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp) But once we slap the label \"criminal\" on someone, they might as well have committed a school shooting for all the fucks they get. Our system is all about retribution and not about rehabilitation. We need to stop treating prison as a way to hurt people for hurting people and start treating it as a way to help people out of their criminal lifestyles while they're kept away for everyone's safety. But once we start thinking about how prisons are supposed to help keep our society safe, not punish everyone who doesn't toe a line, then we'll have to question this whole war on drugs thing.

(save for some incredible sequestration technology that would be purely science fiction at this point) it's going to get worse for *hundreds of years*. Even if we stopped ALL emissions today (HA!), what we've done to the carbon cycle will continue to affect us for centuries.

Usually the local police treat the kidnapping as a runaway and don't look too hard for the kid, and as long as the kidnappers take the child out of state, and the local police don't turn it over to the FBI (who have the authority to look for the kid in multiple states), then the sex trafficers get away with it.

It is important to remember though that trafficking doesn't stop at young girls being exploited for sexual reasons. Young boys are taken into trafficking, adult men and women are taken in and not for just for sex but for slave labor. And to stem further off of this I think people really need to be talking about and figuing out how to combat child pornography. It's horrifying to think about how easy it is for people to obtain and how kids themselves are contributing to the problem without even realizing it. There are individuals whose sole job is to tag child pornography on the internet, the fact that it needs the full time attention of individuals is reason enough to further examine that problem IMO.",

The first year, I won about 10% of the state contract. Normally, there are three firms that dominate the business, and one of them typically has 2/3's to 3/4's of the market. The competitors bring their salt to the state by water transportation, which is dirt cheap, but not available during a hard winter, so they stockpile the entire season's requirement on the docks, then truck it to the counties as orders come in. My modus operandi was to bring in the salt by rail to points closer to the destination, thus minimizing the trucking distance, which is the expensive part of the total cost. I could bring salt in over the entire winter. After my first year in the business, the main supplier to the state sent a letter \"suggesting\" that there be a requirement that all salt be stored in-state by the end of December for the next bid. Of course, they already did that, but it would be very expensive for my business to do create new storage for that. They also had an out of state employee send a $500 campaign contribution to the then-governor, and sure enough, despite the DoT underlings who really appreciated the competition I was bringing to the road salt bid, word came from on high that the requirement was going to be put into the bid. I estimate the state now spends $2 million more per year than it needs to for road salt. Not a bad return on investment for a measly $500 campaign contribution. And that contribution came six months *after* the election. That was just stupid road salt. Now just imagine the same thing going on over all the government for all the things they purchase.",

Even terminal cancer patients are seeing a loss in pain relief. Making it impossible to receive pain relief and issuing guidelines that essentially demonize those who would benefit in an increase in quality of life by using narcotic pain medications, do these organizations not realize that this increases pain-related/chronic illness-related suicides, or drives people in pain to USE street drugs or illegally obtained prescription medication? And now they are fighting kratom. And this anger is coming from someone who has a chronic pain condition, but ALSO has a brother lost to heroin. Should I fight against the machine that creates heroin addicts, or blame my brother for his addiction? Should I fight for pain relief, or concede that I am \"safer\" without pain relief because I've seen what opiods/opiates can DO to a person? I don't have the answer, but a frank discussion is needed. To any of your with a relative or loved one who has chronic pain, I'm sorry for their fight, for your fight. To those with chronic pain who have been denied relief, demonized, made to feel like a criminal for fighting for your well-being, I'm sorry for your fight. For those who have lost loved ones and relatives to addiction, and want to see the world burn and \"the system\" restrict access to these medications to curb the \"opiod crisis\" please look a little closer. Again, I don't have the answer, but it's got to be better than telling people like me, who experiences a dislocation nearly daily, who has no cartilage in either hip socket left and early onset OA.... telling people like me to \"tough it out,\" and \"suck it up.\" And to the doctors who have been brainwashed into compassion fatigue and assume every pain patient who walks through the door is looking for an \"easy fix\" or just a \"fix\" in and of itself, please, take a step back, and remember, \"First, do no harm.\" And I understand the \"system\" and I know the system also demonizes physicians who do prescribe \"elevated\" amounts of narcotics, I know you are in between a rock and a hard place, but we are people first, before patients, before \"clients\" (and to the hospital systems that only see us as clients, please, go fuck yourselves). It's just so frustrating. I don't have an answer. All I seem to have are questions, but no one can answer them. I think kratom may be one good answer, though.",

It's far easier to pick a team and stand on their side of each issue and yell the chants they give you. At the end of the day, people care about what affects them personally.

It used to be talked about more often, during the rise of communism and the cold war era. On a similar note, people seem to accept our current capitalist system as the only one that is possible. After the disaster that was leninist and maoist communism, and 50 years of govt. and corporate propaganda, the young people of today seem to have forgotten there can be anything else. People talk about the symptoms of the current capitalist system, such as global warming, unfair allocation of resources, lack of equality of opportunity, poverty, ect... but not the root causes of these issues. Sometimes we hear complaints, but few propose real solutions. We have the means to feed the entire entire world, the means for all of us to have healthcare, education ect.. but we don't and we really need to ask why. As I said, I have majored in history, and one thing it taught me is that we absolutely can change the system we are in, and there is no such thing as a \"normal\" system. Yet somehow it is often forgotten that the system we live in isn't the only one that is possible. I couldn't agree more with you, people need to think about what is possible, and have higher hopes. If we expect things are going to suck, they will. I personally don't think a \"utopia\" is possible (Considering the etymological root of the word means impossible/fake place), but we still need to at least conceptualize it if we are going to improve things, rather than just focus on what's wrong, we need to think about what kind of world we can live in. Unlike ever before, we have the technology to do amazing things, and people generally, despite what you hear, want to make their community, and world a better place. We need to start thinking about what we want that better place to be like. TLDR: We need to have discussions about the big topics, about how our whole world is run, and how we can make it better. ",

The first is that about 90% of people are financially clueless. Most people had the majority of their wealth in their homes, so they got hit hard when real estate prices crashed. People also have this weird buy high, sell higher mentality of the stock market (and back then the real estate market) that always turns into buy high, sell low in a panic, as it happened in 2008 and 2009. So the average person's wealth was crushed even more. The wealthiest 10% have diversified holdings, so the housing and stock market crashes didn't hurt as much. And while everyone else was panicking and getting out of those assets, the wealthy were **buying** stocks and real estate for cheap. The only way to fix that issue is by educating the masses about personal finance so more people don't repeat these mistakes ad nauseam. Seriously, this happens every time the stock market crashes. The second reason comes from our attempts at economic recovery. These days, central banks lower interest rates, and governments lower taxes and increase spending to give the economy a boost during recessions. Lower taxes and increased government spending (known as fiscal stimulus) = more money in people's pockets = more spending in the economy. Lower interest rates (known as monetary stimulus) make it easier for people to make big purchases and start businesses, which also helps the economy. Interest rates were lowered to historic levels, but this didn't boost the economy as much as hoped because the credit scores of many people were tarnished by the real estate crash. Instead, it simply made assets more expensive, particularly stocks, which the smart wealthy people bought at lows when everyone else was selling in a panic. Additional fiscal stimulus should have been provided to make up for this, but the US didn't get it because politics. Trump became president because of nationalism and promises to provide that fiscal stimulus. Sorry that was long, but hopefully it explains why the wealth gap is where it is today.",

Most of the second and third grade produce has minor discolorations or blemishes, but is perfectly fine to eat. Unfortunately, a lot of it gets thrown away because many grocers won't buy them. I'm sure most farm owners would be happy to donate produce that falls under this category, but transporting it costs money. Oliver suggested that Congress should support a bill that would grant a subsidy to farmers who brought food banks all of their edible produce that couldn't be sold. AFAIK the bill hasn't been passed yet, but that doesn't mean that more food banks can't do what yours is doing. Every pantry located near a farm should reach out to local farmers to see if they throw away edible produce and if they can take this \"trash\" off their hands.",

She is right in the age range where it will always begin to get worse. She is a smart, bright girl. She accepts that the voices aren't real and her therapist said that she is astounded that she adapted such fluent coping mechanisms (listening to music on the bus to drown out invasive thoughts and mental commentary, etc.) JUST LAST NIGHT she was having a total mental break from a night terror. I spent 30-45 minutes trying to find any mental health crisis line (she still lives with her parents) in the country that was open. I end up talking to a calm woman in LA who could talk her through it. Two things here: One. Her parents are in absolute denial of her condition. Face-to-face discussions on this matter have led absolutely nowhere. They refuse to believe she can have it. Two. I've personally shelled out money for TWO psychiatrist visits, since her parents refuse to take her to get treated and she doesn't want them to get billed the copay. Those two months I was picking up food from a food bank because, medication and all, it totally depleted my food budget. The lack of mental health care in this country is atrocious, and the options she can take for free care are totally limited by the stigma she is afraid of for having her condition. And not only is it affecting her, it's affecting me as well. If one day she listens to a loud voice suggesting that she step in front of a bus because \"wouldn't that be hilarious?\" it would affect everyone in her life, and several horrified bus riders as well. Right now I'm ordering generic versions of her prescribed medications online from India and praying to a God that I don't believe in that the only affordable option I've found in this whole ordeal isn't a sham, faulty, or seized by customs for some bullshit. Sorry. I needed to rant. Back to my break.",

But the general misconception is that we did something to *deserve* being a foster child. That actually really hurts us, because generally we get fucked over and can't do anything about it. The system is terrible. We get relocated from family to family and it tends to make it hard for us to make relationships, so we stick to ourselves.

The majority of people brought reusable bags to stores and I was almost always asked if I wanted to buy bags when checking out. I really wish more states would do the same. For example, I now live in Louisiana where there are no such laws and people just throw around plastic bags left and right. I feel like I'm one of the few that brings a reusable bag to the grocery. Whenever I run into the store to buy one thing, the cashier is quick to bag up my ONE thing so I always have to make a point to emphasize no bag. This is what I really don't understand. Not only would dealing with a bag would be more work for me, it's also more work for the cashier. This recently came up in discussing with my family and I was quickly dismissed as just being the \"hippy California liberal\". I mean, I normally try and respect other people's viewpoints but how is \"let's not fill our planet with unnecessary garbage\" a debatable viewpoint? I just don't understand.",

With the watch trade, the quartz movement has been in production for 40+ years and yet mechanical and automatic watches are still in big sellers. There is no perk to having an automatic or mechanical watch. (Aside from not needing a battery change, which kinetic quartz watches also don't need a battery change or solar.) Only knowing that a watch has more time and effort put into the design and production of a watch. Basically my feeling is that jewellers and watchmakers/matchmaking has felt the impact of automation but is unlikely to get much of the brunt of it. Apologise for my terrible english. ",

I didn't know what else to do, so I just went back to business as usual, too. The fact that everyone went back to treating me like normal after the funeral made me feel like I was supposed to be over it. I ended up having a complete mental breakdown because I was trying so hard to just keep going. I never took the time to deal with it, and the grief rapidly snowballed along with the stress at work and home and I just snapped. After that, all everyone could say was that I should have been talking about it, how weird they thought it was that they never really saw me be sad about it. I didn't want everyone fawning over me and making a gigantic deal, but I did want at least the people closest to me to just check on me but no one did. And like you said, who wants to be the downer bringing up death?",

If you pissed her off, she'd give you the silent treatment and just ignore you. One of her handlers and caretakers was a woman who, late in her pregnancy, took maternity leave. Unfortunately, she miscarried. When she returned, the chimpanzee seemed offended that she'd been gone so long, and gave her caretaker the cold shoulder. Eventually, the caretaker just signed, \"My baby died.\" The chimpanzee, who IIRC was a mother herself, responded by running her fingertip down her cheek - the sign language gesture for \"cry.\" This was remarkable in part because chimpanzees don't actually cry when they're upset; it's not something they have the bodily ability to do. The chimp understood that it was a gesture of sadness and *empathized* with her human caretaker. I always find this story remarkable. Empathy is a raw emotion. People shouldn't fear it. ",

They were sending her messages telling her how to make a noose to hang herself, how to slit her wrists properly... And this wasn't even a \"mistake\" like the kind I was talking about, where it's a life lesson you should eventually learn in order to grow up. It was just not getting a joke. I'm willing to bet a lot of them were also teens but some of them were definitely adults. I tried reporting some of it to the staff on that site but the whole thing is a clusterfuck.",

The exceptions to the fever rule is if you're vomiting or have diarrhea or can't eat for more than 24 hours. You don't want to get dehydrated. Blood or strange colors in the stool or vomit is another reason, as well as sudden unbearable, undiagnosed pain. The list is rather long for when you *should* go to the doctor, but the related illness is likely to prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation that lessens the likelihood that you'll be given antibiotics without cause (blurry/double vision, dizziness, muscle weakness, trouble breathing, chest pain, heart racing, etc etc)",

The presence is seen as offensive by some (isn't that what caused the bombing of the USS Cole?) and therefore, you'll get extremists who are willing to fight and even infiltrate other countries to commit mass murder (9/11). I think it's easy to say that US involvement is all about oil and American pride, but I think that there are legitimately bad things going on in many Middle Eastern countries that the world community has decided (to some degree) that cannot be allowed to continue.

I realized that my parents both suffer from it, but they are in complete denial. I asked my mom one day at dinner (I got out of the house when my dad punched my little sister in the face; things blew up and my mom blamed herself like she always does and then the event was just swept under the rug never to be talked about again-like things usually are) if she took any psych meds since she takes a lot of medication. She said, \"no,\" but then looked really self-conscious with this smile and joked, \"what do you think I need to or something?\" No mom. I'm the only one of four girls that's \"crazy\" enough to be put on psych meds. It seems to put my family at ease to just mark me with having \"issues\" and \"being sensitive\", and then just sweeping it under the rug and feinting innocence. I stopped going to therapy when I was younger because my mom griped after quite a few appointments that it was expensive. Yet she enables my three sisters wild spending habits then hands me a laundry list of how stressed out and broke she is. I could go on, but damn, yeah it sucks when parents are there when you're sad over a splinter at 5, but any deeper than a splinter they have no idea what to do about it because they have no idea what to do about themselves.

Tumblr has always appeared like a site for those who are not into \"basic\" or \"contemporary\" culture and therefore develop their own subcultures (ex. fandoms). I can no longer be fully involved in any online group anymore and have deleted most of my social media. I couldn't stand seeing this mob mentality that people seemed to take on. I don't know how to describe it, but it's like once you are apart of an online group for a long time, I see people tend to adopt a certain \"online language\" and adopt central attitudes without even realizing this. Just the similarity of individuals in the way they speak (or more so type since this is the internet), react to things, describe themselves etc. in certain groups has just become so apparent to me. It was strange that Tumblr seems to promote individuality, yet I could stereo-typically categorize many different groups of people on Tumblr as \"basic Tumblr bitches.\" I think people underestimate how much social media can really influence your identity.

Pretty much everything finance related relies on you having someone to co-sign the first time, and if you never had parents, that is WAY harder to achieve. If you don't have a co-signer, you get screwed even harder than normal. For example, I'm trying to get car insurance. If I had parents to have them just add me to their policy, my insurance would be about $40 a month. Since I don't, it's over $200. Same car, same driver.

They can't sell the commodities (paper, plastic, etc) for as high of a price as \"source-separated recyclables\" (two bins) because everything's more contaminated with trash, but they make it up because they're capturing higher volumes of material and have half the truck/driver costs.

The bottom floor of our house was washed away so that only the frame remained, but the top floor was fine except for the water damage from the holes in the roof. Dad and I rode out the storm on the second floor and when the water started to get up there we moved to the attic, but eventually all was well after it passed. We spent the next week cleaning up and tacking up plastic (that thick semi opaque kind) over the frame on the first floor. It was hot as shit inside there so dad slept out on the porch, but I being a 14 year old who like to do what 14 year olds do when they're alone at night wanted to sleep inside. We had been told there were looters around our neighborhood (this was before the national guard came in; set up a checkpoint and concertina wire around our part of town ). I didn't think much of it - people picking through moldy houses looking for jewelry or whatever didn't seem like a big deal. We hadn't heard of any violence, but the few that were arrested had been armed. We had a rough day when it finally came to clear out a path to the road. That night, dad was snoring hard on the porch, and I was inside but I couldn't sleep. It was a pretty night - the moon was big and the sky must have been clear; it was brighter outside than inside. The moon cast shadows from the trees on the plastic. I remember watching those dance around. We'd been here for a while, no looters, and dad had left his shotgun in the house. Really, the first night after my uncle told us about the looters dad stopped sleeping with it on the porch next to him. I noticed the first flash of light on the plastic. It only happened for a second but it was so bright I thought a car was right outside the house, but it was just a flash. Then again, this time it moved I could follow it as it traced the shape of the house. I hadn't really processed what was going on when I noticed a figure on the porch, the opposite side of my dad, but walking around toward where he was by the door. I thought the figure was holding a stick, but as he got to the moon side (closer to my dad) his shadow was pretty clear and I could make out the gun. He was holding it at his waist with the barrel pointing downward. I froze. I thought about yelling. I remember the sound of air making a squeaking noise as I thought better of it and stopped myself. By the time I had found the gun (and the shells the gun wasn't loaded) he was standing over my dad. His gun was angled down at him the same way. I shot twice. The first one knocked him down - he didn't go flying like in the movies but I think as he turned to run he stumbled off the porch. The shotgun knocked me off balance though. The second shot hit the ceiling. I don't remember much. I do remember how quickly my dad got up. And him standing there motionless where the man was. The guy died the shot took out part of his side and he cracked his head when he fell. Dad told the police he had shot the guy. Not much came of it after that. I remember going to court with mom and sitting in the audience but I don't know what it was for and dad had no charges brought against him. We don't talk about it. Idk if I'm over it - it seems like something that happen a long, long time ago. I think I replayed it so much that I changed details/fixated on others. I never saw what the guy looked like. Sorry for the typos. ",

I was 11 years old and had gotten into that tinkering phase kids go through and I was fiddling with my brakes, gears, etc. I went on a ride to a super steep hill that was really popular to test my creation. . As I was blasting down the hill the nut that secures the handle bars jostles loose and I loose all semblance of control. I can remember the car coming towards me from the opposite direction but after that I hit the ground. . The car swerved to miss me and went straight into a tree killing the whole family; Mom, Dad and two Sons. I lived in an extremely small town and the aftermath was horrible. . Long after the candle light vigils (that I still see in my nightmares) and memorials ended I and my family were bullied, harrassed and generally shunned. Kids can be horrible, but as a child I understood that. But the adults of the town; they were cruel. . They called me MK, Murder Kid. By age 13 I attempted suicide. After a lenghty hospital stay my family had to move to across the State out of the town we went generations back in. . Im all grown now and only recently felt safe going back there and to the hill that changed everything, part of my continuing therapy. The worst part about it is at the spot where they died there is a perfectly maintained Cross and flowers bearing their names. . Someone still mourns them. Brings flower and clears the weeds away. I was not prepared for that. It ripped open any feelings of closure I had. In my head, it was over for everyone but me. It wasn't . So how do I live now? One day at a time. There are good ones and bad one but not a day goes by that I don't think about it. It is like living with a disfigurement, perhaps that biblical Mark of Cain? I feel others can see it in my eyes the same way I can. . Edit: This is the first time outside of my family and my sessions that I have shared this since it happened over 15 years ago. The outpouring has been unbelievable. Just so everyone knows: I am no longer sucidial. The guilt and remorse I carry is my own pain. It is a part of me, part of my life and always will be. . From the bottom of my heart: Thank you ",

I got so angry that for the first time, I pushed him back. Instead of falling to the side (or not falling at all) like I thought he would, he fell right off the sidewalk, onto the road (for student parking and buses) and fell in front of a bus.

                    "body": "I was 19. I went over to my girlfriend's house one Saturday morning and we hung out until around 4pm. She was going over to her friends house to go swimming but I had other plans so I didn't go. Her mom asked her to take a bag of trash to the dump when she went, so I told her I'd follow her to the dump and throw it out since it was on my way. I pulled in behind her at the dump. I grabbed the bag out of the back (she was driving her dads truck because she didn't want trash in her car) and I tossed it in the dumpster. I banged on the truck bed twice to let her know she could go, and said bye. I realized after I left I didn't say \"love you\" like I usually did, so I sent her a text. She didn't answer me back, so I just assumed she didn't hear the phone. Her dads truck had loud exhaust so it made sense. I lived about 40 minutes away. When I walked in my front door, I got a phone call from her mom. She was in a panic. She told me there had been a wreck. My girlfriend was alive but she was being flown by helicopter to VCU medical center in Richmond Virginia. I ran to my car and I didn't take my foot off the accelerator until I got to her parents house. We got in her moms car and made the 2 hour drive to Richmond. When we arrived, we walked into the emergency department and went to the front desk. Her dad told the receptionist who he was looking for. At the same time, a doctor was standing behind the counter. The receptionist said the name wasn't in the system so she spun around and asked the doctor. He walked out, introduced himself, asked a few questions to confirm who we were, then he said she was dead. I was standing by a wall. I fell back against it, and slid down to the floor where I sat for a while in pure disbelief. Her parents went down the hall to talk to someone about something. I walked outside and sat beside a big column and smoked a cigarette. I called my parents. It didn't seem like I sat there very long, but I'm sure it was at least 3-4 hours. I just sat there. There are no words to describe that kind of hurt. Most of the next few weeks are missing from my memory. I just laid in my bed and cried. I didn't eat, and I didn't sleep. I just cried and stared at the wall. I cried until there were no more tears left, and cried some more. I weighed 160 before she died. I weighed 120 pounds a month and a half after she died. I know it was hard on my parents watching me like that. My mom tried to get me to eat. I wouldn't. They tried to get me to get out of bed. I wouldn't. They even called a pastor to come talk to me. I told him to go fuck himself. There was nothing that could console me. The love of my life was dead, and I sent the text message that killed her. One day, I just snapped out of it. I got up to go to the bathroom and I saw my reflection in the mirror. I barely recognized my own face. I knew I had the choice to move on with my life, or I'd be dead myself. I'm from a small town, so the only thing for young people to do was hang out in the Walmart parking lot. I got dressed, and drove to Walmart. I saw a few people I knew so I stopped and talked to them. From then on, I spent every evening hanging out in the parking lot. The cops would come around and kick us out, so we'd find somewhere else to park and hang out some more. A year later, we got kicked out of the lot by the cops one night, so we decided to go to somebody's house and drink some beer. We all made phone calls and invited people we knew. It was there, at my friends house, that I met my next girlfriend. Two years later, we got married. This month we celebrate our seventh anniversary. We have two beautiful children, and I've never been happier. I know \"time heals all wounds\" is a really worn out cliche, but it's true. A couple years ago, I was digging through my mom's cedar chest looking for my birth certificate, and found a newspaper clipping from the accident. The newspaper said other motorists reported she swerved to miss a dog, over corrected and flipped the truck. I never knew that was the cause. Knowing that it wasn't my text message lifted a huge burden, but I still don't text.",

                    "body": "I work armed security for a campus police department. Most of the department are police with a few of my type. In my state I'm considered a non-sworn law enforcement and to someone not in the industry have most of the same authority as a police officer. There are differences but for this it is pedantic. I had a guy walk into the area where I was eating my dinner with a cut down the side of his face. So naturally I shift into help mode and am all about getting this guy first aid. He told me someone had just stolen his car and cut his face. So I called for a police officer to handle the felony report and medics for this guys face. Then comes that awkward moment of waiting while this guy bleeds all over himself and the two of us just staring at each other...and I hate awkward moments. My patrol car had trauma kit for active shooter. We're only supposed to use it on fellow officers but fuck that this guy is bleeding all down his shirt. So I offered him that kit with the caveat that I'm not an EMT and he accepted. So I hopped up and went to the door that my car was parked at. Right when I got to the door, this guy was lagging behind me and I don't like people behind me so I stopped and tried to get him to sit down and wait for me to get the kit. That's when he said \"Officer, I have a problem\". I don't remember hearing anything after that so I guess my auditory memory shut off. Right after he said that he conjured up a mini sledge hammer. I have absolutely no idea where it came from it was just there in his hand and he was raising it up high. I dropped what felt like a slow breathy \"ooohhh fuck me\" and I started backing up and drawing my pistol. The situation took a pretty big spiral downward after that because by backing up I tripped over some furniture and fell down between an ottoman and a fireplace grate with my weapon side down to the ground. He was charging through with that hammer up so I couldn't stand up or I'd be in range so I just dove away...into a corner. He plowed through the furniture and I was still on the ground. Right then I cracked. No where to go, no distance to create, the guy I was going to help was going to kill me. All I wanted to do was curl into a ball, cry, and beg for my life. Once that flash of pathetic whimpyness hit, I became pissed. Absolutely livid. I was mad at myself for giving up. Mad at this asshole who thought he could kill me. I've never, ever felt that kind of rage before. I got into a kneeling position and then bum rushed him. I grabbed the wrist with the hammer and shook the shit out of it and he dropped the hammer. Then in my rage all I wanted to do was rip his scraggy beard off his fucking face. My memory blanks out right about there and kicks back in with me leaning waaaayyy back against a high desk and this guy over top of me. To shorten it up, after that he pawed at my holster, tried to grab my neck with both hands, eventually pulled a picture perfect take down and got full mount. Eventually I was on my feet, grappling out in the open with no furniture or anything blocking me and I knew I was too gassed to keep going. There was no hammer anymore but I couldn't keep fighting the grapple fest that we were doing. I shoved him hard, drew my gun, pulled the trigger, *CLICK*...misfire. Hands down the biggest what the fuck moment I've ever had. I managed to shove him again, wrack the slide, then fired two rounds. My auditory memory kicked back in and he said \"Alright, I'm done, I'm done.\" He kind of fell to the floor and was flopping around trying to get back up. I got my radio up and running since the fight knocked it off me and called for back up. He hand a hand down at his waste line and I could see blood up on his shoulder. I just kept my gun on him and waited for back up just trying to breathe and not puke up the food I was just eating. My back up arrived, told me go outside...where I immediately puked up spaghetti and Lemmon pepper chicken. The guy died before the medics could stabilize him in the room. From the time I called for police and medics to the time I called in shots fired, it was three minutes. Take away the awkward staring, me going for a first aid kit, and the radio pick up the whole fight was probably just under two minutes. ",

A squad member of mine was just killed and we were heading to the nearest Forward Operating Base (FOB) to regroup and recover. I was the lead vehicle and noticed a white car driving in our lane, headed straight for us. The adrenaline from the previous explosion and firefight still coursing through me, i do everything i can to stop the vehicle, hand and arm signals, shouting, a damn whistle even. Nothing. So i give a warning shot, still no response. The vehicle is still in our lane, coming right at us. So I light the car up, it veers off and hits a jersey barrier and stops. There is barely enough room to squeak by the car without hitting it but as we are clearing it, i see a man with his wife and a baby in the back seat. All dead. The fucking ass hole should have paid attention. But then again, maybe thats what he was supposed to do...i will never know, but the image of a bullet ridden baby will haunt me until i die. Iraq sucks, man. This is the first time i have shared my story in a public forum and I am way too shaken to re-read this, but it honestly feels really good.",

She was planning on getting up and driving herself to her drs that day, but i usually check on her because she can have bad days. I overslept. It was nearly 11am and i woke to a phonecall from my dad, saying the drs hadnt seen her. I checked upstairs in her room, the kitchen, nothing. Then i saw the bathroom door open a crack. What was in there was basically half a mummy on the floor and feces everywhere mixed with vomit. I dont know what happend, but i called 911 without stepping foot in the bathroom. \"Hello, 911? My moms dead\" The flatpan explanation caught the poor guy off guard completely. I mean i guess i was in shock, but not really that shocked you know? He was in a full panic. I followed along and pretended to perform cpr (her eyes were white, she was covered in vomit, ice cold and drained like a mummy) Sometime later (i dont have an idea for time perspective, it was all moving very slowly) the paramedics showed up. We're a small town, everyone knew us. Im in my underpants, and the lead paramedic is a good friend from highschool. The awkward exchange was...not something i forget. They pretended to do cpr for about 30 seconds, then get a command to keep working on it in the truck. (I messaged him on FB later to ask if that was a show, which it was obviously, he said \"basically, we always do on deceased at the scene\") This was all difficult but just a gory version of expectation, the next part haunts me. I had to call my dad back. He ran home from work. He ran around the house getting her things. He wanted to make sure we had her medical info for the er dr's and her medication list. I kept trying to explain we wouldnt need it. I kept trying to keep him in this world. I was too much of a coward. I was speaking in riddles, i couldnt do it. We get to the er, moved to a small room with cheap furniture you only find in rooms where they tell you people die. The dr came in, and addressed him directly in what mustve been at most 4 sentences. And then stared at him after \"im sorry\". It was like he had been run over by a car. He just sobbed into his hands for ehat felt like hours. He got up without a word and left the room. I found him nearly half an hour later pacing in the parking lot. We decided to get shitfaced. My fiance (now wife) found us somehow 2 hours later 2 blocks away at a bar (to this day i dont know how, she must have checked every bar in town). A total mess. She sat with us for hours. My dad now has a girlfriend. He thinks i hate him for that, but i dont. Hes earned whatever happiness he can find, he pushed through the hardest 4 years of their lives and tried to single habdidky beat cancer with no medical knowledge and no resources. He can be called a lot of shitty things in his life, but for 4 years he showed me what character is.i just wish I couldve been more couragous. It was my place to tell him, not that doctor.",

I was going about 30 and they were going 45 and I hit the front end of their car and they went off road into a metal light pole hard enough to bed it and knock it over. There was with teacher and other students in the car. Being 15 it was weird because I expected there to be more talk around someone's death. Didn't even make the news. Obituary was in the paper but that was about it. When I was driving I did notice the guy but I was always paranoid about people but just thought he will probably stop but I sort of had a gut feeling he wasn't going to. Fucked me up for a bit driving and still super paranoid about other drivers. All that happened was they asked me if I wanted to talk to the councilor and I was like nah. Then we went to hospital to get looked over and I got the rest of the day off school excused. Then I went to school that Monday expecting to go to school all day but a classmate was like \"I'd act traumatized to stay home. So I milked it for a bit and acted like it affected me more than it did so I could stay home from school excused but they caught on after the following 2 days of that and said I needed to come back. I suppose it is supposed to make me feel bad for killing him but it really doesn't cross my mind. That light was green for over 5 seconds before I even got up to it. I don't know why he ran it but feel he was at fault so don't really think about it. Now if it happened now I would probably feel guilty as hell by looking up relatives on Facebook and seeing who he was but this was 1999 all I knew what the paper said and they didn't even put a pic of him in there. I didn't even see the dude in the accident. They came and took us away before they got him out and we sat in the car the whole time. ",

I started crying not knowing what to do which distracted the life guard. Finally someone else noticed and jumped into the pool to save him but it was too late. I've never told anyone this before because I'm so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I know I didn't kill him directly but if I had just spoken up he would probably still be alive with his family. I'll never forgive myself for this. EDIT: Just a little clarification, I grew up in a small town so we only had two life guards on duty (age range 14-19). The pool was always over packed due to having nothing else to do in the heat. But wow reading all your comments really does help with the guilt I have been hiding all these years.

After leaving for most of my life he came back needing me and my family to take care of him. I resented him a lot for that and still do. He seemed clean for a long time until I started seeing foils around the house. He got more and more obvious about it and finally stopped trying to hide it to anyone but me. Well my senior year I was really busy with work and preparing for college. By busy I mean the most time I spent at home was to sleep. I had a lot of money saved up and my entire family knew it and was trying to get their hands on it. One day he asked for some grocery money. I told him I'd buy whatever he wanted since I was heading to the store now. He ignored me and kept asking for money. So I told him I was busy at work and stopped replying. It was pretty obvious what that money was going to be used for at this point. He kept asking for days and I kept refusing saying I could take care of whatever he needed if he just told me what it was. Well I came home for lunch one day and my mom runs to his house to bring him his lunch. I am leaving to go back to school when she runs out of the house yelling for help. My step dad and I run in after I dial 911 and have him recite the address. I saw him and knew he was dead right away but my mom insisted he was alive and just passed out. Well after that awful experience I couldn't help but think what the money he wanted was for. That withdraws kill people. That it was my fault. I know logically it wasn't my fault and if it wasn't then he would have died sooner or later but it creeps into my head when I'm having a hard time. No matter how much anyone tells me it's not my fault it still feels like it is. For clarification my mom and dad are divorced and he moved in across the street for help.",

(our town in Norway was quite small and quite high in elevation so the best trees were down towards the river) We decided to get together one friday and head down to the river to do some climbing. We always took a backpack with lunch and snacks and water with us so we could hang out in our tree until dark. It was my friends younger brother (11) who was carrying the backpack full of snacks, and I was carrying the backpack full of drinks. My friends younger brother was not as used to climbing trees as we were, but like any little brother he wasn't about to let that stand in his way and prevent him from hanging out with his big brother and his best friend, as it was a rare occurance we'd let him hang out with us. We were almost to the part of the tree where there was a spot for us to all be able to sit, I got there first and i hung my backpack up on a tree branch. I then told my friends little brother to pass me his backpack so I could hang it on the branch and make it easier for him to get to where I was. While he was passing me his backback, his foot slipped off the branch and he didn't have the upper arm strength to carry his own weight yet. He fell the whole way down the tree, landed in the river onto jagged rocks and was killed instantly. My friend and I were out of that tree faster than I even thought it was possible, and what we saw that day changed us forever. All he wanted to do was hang out with his big brother and do what the \"big kids\" were doing. I feel like if I never told him to pass me his backpack, we'd all be in a tree right now drinking a beer thinking back on all our ventures. But instead, my best childhood friend can no longer be in the same room as me, I have not heard from him or his family in over 10 years and every single day of my life they pop into my mind and I remember what I did. Everyone tells me it wasn't my fault and it could have happened to anyone, but that doesn't erase the guilt I feel about asking for that stupid backpack. If anyone has a chance to read this and if you are going to get anything from my story, its that... anything can happen, anywhere at anytime. And tell those you love, that you love them because you never know when someone will ask for their backpack. ",

Ended up killing a large amount of Taliban fighters. It never bothered me, since I was just telling the pilot what to shoot, but the pilots did the actual \"trigger pulling\". Edit: Over the years, people I tell this to have been evenly split over wether *I* technically killed anyone. Some have insisted that it was the pilots who did the killings. Others say that since the pilots wouldn't have been there if he hadn't brought them, and wouldn't have known what to shoot if I hadn't told them, then we *both* did the killing. I've never cared either way. It was war, they were trying to kill my Marines and I, and it needed doing. ",

We were driving late at night on US 277 between Piedras Negras and Del Rio. It's kind of the armpit of Texas - flat, straight, boring, right near the border. I was at the wheel, my driver mentor was in his bunk, but awake chatting with me. I saw headlights ahead, a long way off. Didn't think anything of it. After awhile, they got close, and it looked like they went to turn left, only there wasn't a road there. Then they straightened out and drove right into us head on. I had just enough time to see that it was a Tacoma, and the driver was male. All I could do was let go of the steering wheel and hit the brakes. We were busted up pretty badly, but we cut that pickup in two. I had a broken wrist, my mentor had a bunch of broken ribs and a bruised liver. We got out to see the damage and when we walked to the rear I saw a work boot sitting on the double yellow line, with about 6 inches of leg sticking out. I still get an odd feeling in my stomach when I think about it. Obviously, I didn't plan to kill the guy. And there wasn't much I could do without foreknowledge - semis aren't exactly nimble. But it still takes a bit to tell yourself you couldn't have done something else. He had a young wife and two little girls. ",

He dropped instantly. I remember how shocked and quick and largely uneventful it was. It wasn't even remotely dramatic. In fact it was almost more humorous than anything. I remember one guy named Bob, a crazy Polack son of a bitch Cleveland shouted \"Bullseye Hilljack (his nickname for me)!\" I later found his body and I remember he looked older (like he was around 30, I had only just turned 18). He was a little bit fat and I remember he had really good teeth (most Vietnamese didnt). Felt a little bit uncomfortable as I had just taken a mans life but I felt good overall, knowing one less enemy was in the jungle. I served several more tours in Vietnam.

Let me preface by saying we have a dog and only sleeps with me even though he protects my mom like a mofo. Jack Russel do not look scary but if they are protective they won't let go. Anyway I am sleeping one night and have my audio books going and my dog jumps on the side of my chest. Which I know and I don't know if he knows that something isn't right. So I quitely turn down my speakers and hear breaking of glass and footsteps. Not like normal footsteps but like foot pounding. My mother who takes ambien is snoring in the next room and I know something is wrong. I get up butt as naked and about to open my door and it knocks me down, he takes two shots at my dog and I do not know if it was adrenaline fear or whatever but it was just in a blink. I came up hit him with all the force i had and kept hitting him till i got in the big bathroom where it was almost all glass. Then going back and forth I stabbed him with a piece of mirror. My mother wakes up and i'm screamed POINT POINT POINT. The dog comes to her and she gets out the backdoor and goes to the neighbors. I was taught that in emergency we have trigger words. Guard means go after the dog. Point means get the dog and go and leave me. Home, which is her word is when she is in danger and the dog and me both go after whoever. ...anyway grabbed the guy who was killed in the bathroom gun and fired back and hit both point blank in the head. And I all can think about to this day is I just killed three people. I was sitting naked in the bathroom in this guys blood just crying. Thinking if they had kids and needed help or did this to support their families. Squeezing a trigger is easy, living with it is something else. That is why I attend support meetings for people who have lost someone, which it helps but still wake up most nights scared to death of what I did. ",

Well she ran over the kid and killed him. She is now 82 and scared of driving and blames this curse of killing the kid as reason for five of her 8 biological kids having died. 2 drownings 1 motorcycle wreck 1 cancer 1 drugs. She still drove a bus for 20 more years after this but it weighs heavy on her daily and is really worried about going to hell as the gets closer to death herself. On a side note...... I was young and the accident was kept from me but I grew up very athletic and strong and tall compared to my family and really most other people..... I was a d1 basketball player in college and very protective of her in general. One day (I was 18) she ran into the father in public and since it was kept from me all I saw was a 5'7\" man yelling and cursing my mom and my mom crying so I come flying in and beat this man to a bloody pulp before I can be pulled off him. So I grab her and put her in the car and quickly leave and this is where I learned about who he was and why he was angry at her. He committed suicide like two months later after I beat him up....... The mother committed suicide like 2 years after the accident and the younger brother OD'ed on drugs like 6 months after the dad suicide. So yeah pretty fucked all the way around!",

It is hard to describe the feeling - the closest I would get is non-sexual arousal. Everything heightened. I've tried numerous drugs since but nothing has matched it. I was always careful - snuck out and did it at night, away from people who could see me. Made sure not to set a fire that was too big to control. (tip: all fires can become too big to control). It was fun. I thought I had everything under control. One time I decided to increase the stakes. There was an outbuilding behind the church that I thought would be fun to burn. Nobody ever used it, no one would mind its loss. Larger than anything I'd burnt before. I don't know why but the fire got too big for me to control. It spread and I ran away. It spread to the main building and it went up like tinder. Its really hard to type this because its forcing me to confront the truth of it. That it actually happened and it wasn't a dream.

Found her annoying and awkward to be with most of the time. I really think that was the reason why she started hanging out with the wrong kind, to seek validation she never had at home. Worst of all, she met a guy during that time. Guy is a playboy, used her as a tool to get what he wants (it's her first love experience), both of them did drugs together and stuff. Guy used to come to my house and my meet my family, even used my dad's money for his car repairs and shit. Fast forward, the guy dumps my sister to get back with his ex. My sister is absolutely devastated, keeps thinking and mentioning the guy every fucking day. My family and I are pissed as hell but there's not much we could do, as we were worried that if we went scorched earth on that motherfucker, my sister might lose her mind. Things were relatively calm...When suddenly I received a phone call from my dad. He was crying when he told me my sister died of an OD. Turns out, she wanted to be close with him so bad, she bought concert tickets for herself, him and his group of friends. Went to said concert and got fucked up on drugs. She OD'd, guy and friends left her to die alone (I verified from eyewitnesses). I feel guilty for her death mostly because of two things: 1) I knew they were doing drugs together (and didn't say anything about it), but it was just weed. I have a lot of friends who smoke and I knew weed wasn't all that dangerous. I didn't know she was popping pills behind my back tho. I blame myself because I think I played a part in her eventual downfall into drugs, by not saying anything (as a brother should). 2) The guy was a playboy who broke many hearts. I was one too. I think my sister died for my past sins. Kinda like a fucked up version of an eye for an eye. Number 1,2 and the fact that I wasn't a good brother at all caused all this. If I did better, all of this wouldn't have happened. My family will never see her again. My future kids will never know her smile and grace. And it's all my fault.",

So I was living with a few friends in a house share, one evening it was my turn to put the bins out, but it was raining hard outside and I was comfortable. So I ran the bags out to the back alley and left them next to the trash can(which was already full) as I passed out of our back gate, however, one of the bags got caught on the latch and ripped a bit, spilling a bit of garbage out into the back lane. Because it was raining I decided I'd clean it the next morning and ran back in doors. I end up sleeping in the next day and I get up at around mid-day to sort the garbage out. As I head out into the lane I see that there is garbage everywhere, I assume that the seagulls must have got at it and I start to clean it up. I head back inside and my friend sees me and tells me that the lady next door has had an accident. Apparently, early in the morning she had heard the seagulls in the lane squawking and tipping the trash bag apart, she had started to clean up the mess but had slipped and hit her head. She was in her 80's and after getting back inside she felt ill and had a bad turn. The ambulance had to come get her and later that day she had died. Brain aneurysm :(. Now I don't know how those work but I'm guessing that the slip and bang to the head was the reason for this happening. I felt very guilty for not having cleaned the mess up when it had happened and now I have this nagging feeling every time I think something could create a hazard for someone else.

Nothing out of the ordinary, we ran around getting every dope boy to front us at every opportunity. This time we went to the same man who he had screwed over a few days earlier. Took the guy 6 hours to get there, we had my car, and only enough cash for either a hit or gas to drive to him. So we waited in my dead ass car fiending. Talked about all sorts of things, music, life, all the wonderful things we were going to do. Our guy showed up, we got the dope, nothing seemed off. Even gave it to us in a fresh rig! Taylor took the hit. 50/50 shot that hit was mine had things gone differently, and he would be here, I dead. The guy gave him a hot shot, basically as I understood it at the time it was battery acid that Taylor shot directly into his veins. He gasped. He shook. He looked at me with a look I will never forget. He convulsed and vomited. I can only imagine the pain he felt. I know that fear of powerlessness in that moment, no matter what I did he was dead, I still remember his eyes staring up at me while I freaked out. And then, just like that, he was gone. It was so fucking sudden. Like one second here is all essence of this life right in front of me and then the next it is so clear that it is gone. The muscles holding the expression on his face relaxed, the fucking sigh as gravity pushes the breath out. I will never forget.",

We had just started a new tour with an artist, but as a crew a bunch of us had been working for several artists over the last few years. When you work these long hours, sometimes under ridiculous pressure and circumstances, and live on a tour bus, sleeping a few feet away from 11 other grown adults, one of two things happen: - you just get in with it, drink away any sadness you have from being so exhausted and missing your family and friends because you haven't seen them in months - or you become incredibly close, like a family. You're together through everything, long incredibly hard days, or experiencing the joy of something or somewhere new. On this particular tour, it was going to be a smaller group of us than the last tour. No need for a video technician. But we really liked the video technician. We had done a year or two together, and he was a really great kid. Always saw the bright side of everything. You could always count on him to have a smile on his face, no matter how many hours we had been working. Lucky for the tour, more video equipment was added, and so he came out to join us right as we were going into rehearsals for the tour. We went through a week of rehearsals, then took a ferry to Victoria from Vancouver, to start the tour. First show done, we all had such a great time, a really easy first day; load in (the install) went quickly, the show went off without a hitch, and we finished a few hours earlier than we expected. We went to back to the hotel to get some food and have a drink. Our rooms were next to each other. It was a nice spring night, we sat outside on our adjoining balconies. He was a wine expert, he loved red wine. I had an unopened bottle of red in my room, and he had an unopened bottle of white in his room, which he knew I liked. He leaned over his railing to pass me a bottle, which I easily grabbed from him, the balconies were so close together. So I passed him the bottle of red from my room. But he slipped, on the wet balcony. After this point, I have no memory of any sounds. But everyone on the tour staying on that side of the hotel, heard me screaming. I saw him go over the railing. I saw him hit the side of the hotel. And I saw him land, 50' below me. I ran to the elevator, yelled at the front desk to call 911 on my way past. But it was too late. It wouldn't have mattered. I got to him, and looked into his eyes and they were lifeless. A large piece of the back of his head was a few feet from us. I held his hand and sobbed that I was sorry, until a security guard pulled me off. From that day, we were a tour family, connected by the worst bond imaginable. ",

As my boss put it, \"Get her to sign this time.\" Well, she came in and was obviously upset about the situation. I went through the details and the guy had treated her and their children horribly. He did, in fact, owe her thousands. I got her to sign a contract and set to work on the Motion for Contempt of the court's order for child support. I did a good job. The motion was a litany of his sins for him and the judge to read. A paralegal put the papers together and I dropped it off at the courthouse for sheriff's service on my way home. Out of sight and out of mind for a few weeks, maybe more than a month. I came into work on a Monday morning and my secretary said, \"[Jabbawookiee], did you hear about [case]?\" \"Nope. What of it?\" \"Go talk to [boss].\" I headed to his office, curious, and told him I was told to ask him about the case. \"Oh. Well. I got a strange phone call from [another jurisdiction] sheriff's office. You know Mr. [Case]?\" \"Yeah. Well, I don't know him, but know of him. He's a deadbeat.\" \"Well, dead is right.\" \"Dead?\" \"Yeah. The sheriff called asking for you. Apparently, he hanged himself in a motel room in [other state]. They found your motion under his dangling feet.\" \"Hm. The pen is mightier than the sword?\" He laughed. \"That's pretty cold, [Jabbawookiee].\" \"Well... thanks for letting me know. We're refunding the retainer, right?\" And then I had an argument with my boss when he didn't want to refund the retainer. Anyhow, the ladies in the office said I killed the guy and my bossed called me Killer for a week or two until the joke wore thin. I was assigned all the contempt motions after that.",

A guy at school, total bully, always a dick to everyone started picking on me hard cause I was losing sleep, falling asleep in class and was prone to emotions due to complete lack of sleep and help at home since mom was literally wasting away and dying in front of me with no family to help. So one day as I am walking home from school the asshole is playing in the park, he is alone, I skirt it wide and cut through the basketball court hoping to avoid him but he spotted me. Well, he started in with his shit and yanked my bookbag off, kicked me and pushed me down, so I cam back up swinging and we really started fighting and throwing punches. As he went to throw a haymaker at me I dodged it by spinning and intended to hit him with a backfist or something. Well he went flailing forward and I hit him in the back of the neck with my elbow, hard. Now at 14 I was already a big kid, 250 pounds, football player, so I packed a bit of a punch. He went down hard, arms at his side, forehead straight into the ground and didn't move, head at a weird angle. I ran home, called the police and ran back to see what I could do to help. I lied, I told them I saw him laying there and called the cops. He was alive. I fully expected him to tell on me, I went to the hospital to see him after he was able to take visitors. He was paralyzed from the chest down. He never told on me, we became friends after and he died a little over a year after it all happened. He told me not long after he left the hospital that he forgave me and that he knows it was his fault. Him getting hurt was an accident, I never wanted him to be so badly hurt, just to stop bullying me. --- The next person actually deserved it though. I was 16 when this happened. My niece, 12 years old, told the authorities that her stepfather had raped her. As you can guess this ruined his life. As it rightly should if it had been true. But it wasn't true. My sister had found drawings my niece had done which were sexually explicit in nature. She confronted her daughter who, being afraid of being found out, lied and said that her stepfather had been molesting her. The truth was she had been secretly having sex with the 16 year old boy who lived a street over. He was a complete douchebag, smoked, acted like he was gods gift to women, greasy hair, baggy pants, zero redeeming qualities, everything a 12 year old girl would be smitten with, and he took advantage of that. She confided this in me. I told her mother what her daughter had told me, she was once again confronted and recanted, but the damage had already been done, her stepfather was already in jail awaiting trial, their marriage was already ruined and she had filed for divorce and the stress had already ensured the marriage was done for. They let her stepfather out of jail, but his livelihood was still ruined anyway, he shot himself in the head down by the river 3 days after getting out of jail. The following day my niece took her life via pills. About 2 weeks later I was over helping my sister pick up the pieces and I was walking down the street with a baseball bat, having just played baseball with my remaining niece and brother. I ended up on the same street as the guy who actually did rape my niece and I confronted him. I asked him point blank if he had been fucking my niece, he sneered at me and said \"yeah but what the fuck\" and that's about as much as he got out of his mouth before the bat hit his face. He went down hard, I then hit both of his knees over and over and left him sitting there at the top of the steps leading down to the porch and to his house bleeding and in pain, but alive. I didn't intend to kill him, however he apparently crawled down the stairs and fell into the pool trying to make his way into the house. He drowned in the pool. I am not sorry, he caused the death of my niece and my brother in law. I wish I could go back again and do it again. The bastard deserved worse. ",

My wife and I had only been there a few hours and there was a hospice nurse (?) there too, and my wife's grandmother was in clear distress. Her breathing was labored, she was essentially unconscious, and she was basically orange from (at minimum) kidney failure. I remember not really understanding at the time, but my wife would tell the nurse every so often, \"I think she's still uncomfortable\", and a look was exchanged, and the morphine was given. This was all new to me because in my upbringing people died in hospitals, not at home. I wouldn't have believed it were I not there, and because I'm not a very spiritual or emotional person, but there came a moment when this old, oddly-colored woman opened her eyes, looked around at everyone, and said, \"I love you all\". Took one more breath and died right then and there. I remember feeling \"good\" about her death, and about the people that were there for it, and I came to understand the unspoken collusion, for lack of a better word, between two people who knew death. When I consider the alternative, the more familiar protracted, brightly lit, colder and lonelier death in an unfamiliar and impersonal hospital room, I'm glad there are people like my wife, and that hospice nurse, and you, who have the wisdom and experience to do \"that which is not discussed\" when it's the right thing to do.",

My three friends died in the accident and I had major injuries. > I'm doing fine now (6 years later) my body always aches and is sore, my dexterity is not so great anymore. And I have hearing loss (not to the point where I'm considered impaired)but I definitely have to ask for things to be repeated a lot. I have some memory loss as well and I am definitely more forgetful now. I have some issues about driving but I do it. But mostly I just miss my friends every day which sometimes takes a toll on me. Positively, the accident has made me appreciate my life and the people I love so much more and really has pushed me to live a life more full and happily. (Everything sounds so clich\u00e9) > I really would not want to go through it again, please. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. You're very strong, and I hope things get better for you every day.",

I got up on a roof to get a better view and then immediately got lit the fuck up.

It's its own thing and it's just there and there's nothing you can do about it but let it exist and own it. This horrible, ugly, thing happened and now it sits in my living room.

Plenty of kids do things like that, that might be risky or dangerous, because they're *kids* - by definition, they aren't adults and it's not reasonable to expect them to be as responsible as adults. So, I'll say it again even though it looks like I'm about the 1,000th person to do so - this wasn't your fault. There's no reasonable way to classify what happened in your story as 'murder', and the idea that grown-ass adults actually called you 'murder kid' utterly disgusts me. I'm happy for you for having a supportive family that was willing to move to give you a chance to start over, though, and I wish you the best. I hope the well-wishes you get here help you move forward, and get closer to coming to terms with your childhood.",

You got unlucky (and so did they) and it was bad. It's ok to wish it hadn't happened, and ok to be sad that it did. Just because shit happens doesn't mean we have to be happy about shit happening. But don't feel bad about it, because it has nothing to do with you -- it's just some bad luck, and there's nothing anyone can do to prevent it. ",

We were walking home from school. About to cross a busy road and I decided, \"fuck it, I'll just run across quickly\" while a car was coming. I thought I'd be able to outrun it as I'd done many times in the past, but the guy with me obviously didn't think I'd be able to, so he grabbed my backpack so as to halt my in my tracks. Unfortunately it had the effect of tripping me over, face flat on the floor in the middle of the road with a car coming right for me. At that moment I thought I was actually going to die. And the next few seconds went by in a flash, like, it felt instant. But before the car hits me, that guy grabs my backpack and drags me by it all the way to the other side of the road before the car hits us... I survived, but I was covered in scrapes and bruises from being dragged across the fucking floor and it hurt like hell.",

It is now my firm belief that it is the politicians that should be held responsible for putting soldiers in positions where simple misunderstandings can have such grave consequences. All their talk of precision strikes and clinical attack are bollocks. The truth is that you did what you had been trained to do, and did it well. As you mention, if you had reacted differently it could very easily have been you on the receiving end. Soldiers in modern war zones deserve way more respect than they are given.

I ended up with a spiral fracture of my fibula and a broken and dislocated ankle. Typical recovery time but the injury itself was pretty awful; the surgeon was being reminded of which patient he was seeing in the hallway outside my last checkup, and I could hear him remark about remembering how nasty it was. I'm really good in a crisis so I was very calm although shaking before the paramedics came, so I took a picture of my dislocated ankle. The first two pictures were just a blur and it took me a while to realize that I was shaking so hard. The two-year-old was just fine. She was understandably freaked out but didn't realize it was such a bad situation by my calm reaction after the first minute or so. The tough part about recovery lately is that I have three children in the middle child is four and a complete terror. I regularly have to drag her into her room for timeouts and I'm only just now firm enough on my feet to not worry that I'm going to fall on her while doing so! I'm certain if it happened she would forever remember that I gave myself a terrible injury to avoid falling on the two-year-old but I totally fell on the her!",

She started claiming that all sorts of things were 'triggering' her and that things I did were 'triggering' her. It eventually pissed me off enough, having had people in my life with actual PTSD, that I started demanding to know where the fuck she got PTSD from where me making a dick joke to her that she'd made to me three weeks prior could suddenly trigger her PTSD. She had no idea what I was talking about. She literally had been led to believe that \"triggered\" meant \"said something I didn't like\" and that anything that makes you feel negative feelings makes you \"triggered\". I tried to explain to her what the word actually means, but it was futile, and she wound up falling into that circle jerky circle of death. People like that are the ones who are easiest to point at and laugh, because they take an actual medical condition and turn it into their circle jerk feel-good session of the week. One week, they'll call themselves feminists. Another week, they'll call themselves humanists. The next week, they'll be complaining about being triggered. Their attention span jumps elsewhere pretty quickly, but they tend to be loud and memorable, so the memories people have of those colossal idiots that claimed to be 'triggered' over everything live on for a very long time. And of course, some people never do move on to the next shiny thing, and just keep the perpetual circlejerk of misinformation going. You'll find a lot of folks on the internet and especially on the hateful side of the internet who use these idiots as a flagship example of anything they disagree with, be it feminism, racial equality, gay rights, trans rights, knowledge of PTSD and mental health disorders, etc. You'll hear long diatribes with all sorts of \"factual evidence\" about what loonies all these people are, how they represent all libtards, etc. Those circles of goddamn self-aggrandizing idiots have done more to damage the public perception of PTSD than anything else I have heard of. Just when people were starting to culturally accept PTSD as a genuine problem to the point where people could actually be open about dealing with it, these knuckleheads come along and take all the genuine problems people with PTSD face and turn them into a comedic internet meme. It fucking grates on me something fierce.",

I was a team leader and was constantly told by higher-ups to suck it up and drive on but I wasn't going to put myself through hell for wars I didn't agree with. I ended up having to go over my higher-ups' heads and talk to a group of people called Ombudsman who are basically there to help with issues like mine. After meeting with them for the first time I was in my commanders office marking my appointments on his personal calendar. I was basically shunned by my platoon and put on every shitty task they could find for me. I was eventually sent to a new unit for soldiers with medical issues, but only after receiving an Article 15 for disobeying orders and demoted one rank.

It'd crush her and my parents if I told them how bad things are and I'm terrible at voicing things so I'd probably mess up when trying to tell them anyway. Been this way for years and just started medication last october with no success with the medications I've tried so far, and been passed along twice so far with 2 different therapists and they've now passed me up the chain for a full mental health evaluation and medication management team so fingers crossed they can work out which wires are plugged in wrongly in my brain and what medication will actually help! EDIT: thanks for all the advice everyone, this is honestly only the second time I've ever told anyone. I'm currently waiting on therapy at the end of the month and I'm trying to find the right medication. I find it difficult to talk to people and have always struggled opening up, but the last therapy session helped and she's sent me on higher up the chain for better help for me essentially. Again thanks for your kind words everyone EDIT#2: It's incredible to see just how much support there is on Reddit, and for those of you in similar situations I truly understand what you're going through. I know it's different for everyone, I'm just about to turn 21 and I've had suicidal thoughts since I started secondary school at 11. Last October, a young doctor finally convinced me to open up and started me down the road to getting help and I know this is the right thing. Any of you in my position that feels like you can't talk to anyone, at least try talking to a doctor, someone impartial, and they will help you. I'm finding it incredibly difficult because there's never been anything truly horrible or any big situation that has made me feel this way. And I feel guilty that I feel like this when there's so many people in the world in tragic places and people who've had horrible upbringings. So I've had a couple different types of therapy, standard therapy and CBT and they feel I need to have a full mental health evaluation to find what's happening in my brain to stop any happy juice flowing. And I have lows all the time and I go about my life day to day but I'm not giving up this time when people are trying to help. I hope you unfortunate people try the same! And thank you again everyone for support for both me and anyone else in my situation. It's people like you that helps us through it! And anyone in the U.K. If things get really bad there are people to call such as the samaritans and rapid response, they're friendly people that want to help you! <3 for you all.",

However, I freaking LOVE meat and crappy-for-you food. I can't cook it as much in the house because my fiance has a nose like a freaking bear and will know if I cook it. So I eat fast food for lunch once or twice a week and when she's gone for the evening. Definitely down from how much I was eating a few years ago, but it's hard to kick the habit.",

Tom was super shy, and he was working up the nerve to ask her out for weeks (he'd been asking me a million times things like what girls liked or where they liked to go, and kept trying to get me to be a wing-girl which was hard because Dana and I hardly knew each other.) Well, one day Tom and I are at the park doing something for a traiathalon that was happening, and Dana shows up. Tom finally has the nerve to ask her out. He walks up to her and she turns around. Surprise- it isn't Dana. It's her usually-quiet, barely seen older sister (let's call her Rose.) And she looks like she's gonna pass out. so Tom gets her into the shade with a bottle of water and some crackers and offers to call a doctor, but she declines. He sits and talks to her for a while, and they agree to meet up again. One thing led to another, and now they're married and they're the cutest thing I've ever seen. But he won't ever, ever tell her that the reason they met was because he tried to ask out her sister. ",

It just really hurt my feelings when I found out and I know he would be crushed because he really likes my older sister. I got so pissed that they were saying that when the older sister hasn't had a boyfriend in like 5 years and the younger sister only dates rude assholes or passive, silent guys that she can abuse. I ended up telling my mom that it was bothering me they were saying stuff about my boyfriend and she was like \"He's *your* boyfriend! You of all people know he's not gay!\" and said some stuff about how neither of my sisters can keep a good guy around. ",

One had a great personality, but lacked in social skills. One liked going out and meeting people but ended up addicted to the social scene and never wanted quiet time. One was really hot and sexually driven, but had a shitty, hateful attitude. When you meet that person that provides a healthy balance of all your favorite things - you've found the holy grail and every other person before doesn't hold up to your current SO. Hell, you even stop thinking about the past and how much effort went into \"trying to get laid\" or \"trying to find a girlfriend\" which required getting to know them, their likes and dislikes, their annoying little quirks, the first fight you get into, terrified thinking that you're about to break up. It was exhausting and completely risky with every new person. However, we both agree that our past experiences were what taught us tricks in the bedroom, in being communicative, being respectful of boundaries, likes, dislikes, and buttons that aren't to be pushed. I don't regret it, but I'd never want to go back to square one. I've found my one, and we're best friends. My point is, I guess, is that your worries about him are most likely just I your mind - and he's all about your beautiful butt. Key to a healthy relationship? Communication and open discussions about things that are bothering you then and there. Good luck, and as worth it as it is coming from an internet stranger, he most likely thinks about his ex's way less often than you think about his ex's. <3 Enjoy life as it comes.

I understand your hesitancy because you don't want to make her feel guilty, especially given her relationship history. You have to figure out a way to express it without it being her fault. If you start saying \"I can't finish anymore because you gave me bad responses to my come ons which hurt my self esteem and its been going on for 8 years\" she will probably respond poorly. But if you frame it right, and have a kind and honest conversation, it could save your relationship. You can say it only started happening recently, or frame it in a \"white lie\" kind of way that won't be detrimental to her. You can't put 8 years of repressed feelings into the talk because that will doom it to fail. You are the one who hasn't brought it up sooner so you can't put that on her, and it wouldn't be fair to. But if you say that there are some changes you'd like to make in your sex life, and that you have recently been struggling with your sexual self esteem and need a boost from her, that could be a productive conversation. I hope I'm being clear- I'm not saying you should lie to her, but that you should frame the conversation in the here and now so that neither of you get really hurt from it. Talking about sex makes you so vulnerable and you have to be very kind. And in this case the kinder thing to do would probably be to not let her know how long this has been going on. Getting help from a professional on how to have this conversation could be really helpful, and might just save your sex life. Good luck and I hope you're able to talk this one out. ",

As someone with depression it is so hard to explain what I go through to someone who does not have depression. It's also hard to understand. Think about the person trying to help, which is all they are trying to do. Just because they do not understand what depression is, does not mean they don't care. They simply do not know what you're going through, and in order for this relationship to work, there needs to be empathy both ways. I understand some people will just straight up say \"cheer up! You'll be fine!\" and you know what? To them, that might help, and that's fine. We know obviously this is not the case and people with depression cannot just cheer up. But that's why we need to talk more about it. Bring attention to the darkest parts of our minds. Show people that depression is very real, it's an illness, and that it's important to deal with. We are not simply sad, for that would imply something bad happened. We are sad simply because we are. We need to change that. We need to be happy again. Tldr: Wow I kind of went off there. My point is that people generally want to help, but with mental illness it is very hard to do so. ",

This is NOT uncommon. And she may not have even been \"horny\" for all those guys, but rather in need of a self esteem boost. The fact she said that now that she has you she's changed... I think means that you have managed to build her up enough and make her value herself enough that she no longer needs to constantly get laid in order to feel happy and secure in who she is. Does it suck for your blueballs? Yes. But I really don't think it has anything to do with her attraction to you. I think she just bumbled her words.

My reasoning is that there is no evidence (that I know of) that supports free will, but plenty that opposes it. People just don't like the fact that their perception of free will is pre-determined. There is also an argument I've heard that this would give negative implications on our current way of doing things (the justice system for example), but the fact that we have proven that behaviour can be altered through methods such as conditioning, means that this isn't true. We would still be able to deal with things in our current method, as there is proof it works. People would still be responsible for their actions, as they still chose to commit them, it's just that these actions can technically be predicted. Overall, I feel that people are so caught up on 'having' to have free will, that they fail to take into account that knowing that our actions can be pre-determined and calculated, changes nothing.

But in the world of the internet, do years of professional experience mean you have any knowledge about children? No, apparently only those who have actually given birth can know anything about child care. Man, I commented on a Facebook post about a mother who accidentally killed her newborn infant through ignorance. (edit: for those who are curious, she was breastfeeding, but didn't realize that her body wasn't producing milk. She thought non-stop crying was normal for newborns, and didn't realize her infant was crying out of hunger). My post said that in an ideal world, people would have to get experience with infants *before* becoming actual parents. Someone else replied to inform me that being a parent has **no** similarity caring for a child without being a parent, and that being a parent changes your heart and makes you see things in a different light, and how can I possibly compare them? I *know* that conceiving a child is life-changing, and one of my friends, after previously disliking kids, fell in love with her own. But it was after a post about a parent, who *accidentally killed her infant* through ignorance. How can you claim that conceiving and giving birth is some magic pill that means you know everything and child care providers who aren't parents know nothing?",

If you mean that some songs have more variance in the chords they use (there may be a more official name for that but I don't know because I have not studied music beyond a fairly basic level) or that some songs have more unique lyrics, then you are right, those are objective things. However, I think /u/isaacandcompany is talking about what music people like more. And liking one musical style over another is not really objective. Now, admittedly some people brag about how unique their favorite artist is and they might be objectively wrong about that, but if they just like some music because it sounds good to them, I can't say that is objectively wrong.

In the US you have more flexibility to pay more than you otherwise would have (or less, in fact) since the cost of the service and the cost of the food itself is more separated. You know ahead of time that all servers effectively work on commission so you just factor it into the cost of going out to eat. Tipped waitstaff can make a fortune in this system, especially if they're working on high-value times in good restaurants and end up better off than if they were working for a fixed wage with less of a tip culture around them. It sucks that the floor is $2.13 per hour (or whatever it is currently) but the system as a whole isn't terrible because of it - it just needs some adjustments. ",

The parent was concerned because her 2-year-old daughter had regressed in potty training and wasn't responding to any of the forceful techniques she was using. I told her that regression was completely normal after a new baby was born (the mom had given birth to a baby brother less than a year before), and that from what I had observed working with the child, she was using potty training as a control tactic. I told her that every child develops some sort of control tactic at that age, and potty training is a super common one because parents tend to get so desperate to get it done. My advice was that potty training was going to seem a lot harder as long as she was trying to force it, and I thought she just needed to let her daughter go through the regression stage. I gave her some tips on one-on-one routines she could do with her daughter to help her get over wanting her diaper changed, on phrases she could use to help her daughter understand the sensations related to soiling a diaper, and ultimately how to eliminate negative punishments related to accidents and replace them with teaching the cleanliness aspect as she starts to get that she doesn't like the feeling of going in her diaper. The mother let me finish all of this and then glared at me and said \"Do you even have kids?\". No, I don't. But nevermind my degree. Nevermind my years of experience. Nevermind the fact that I contributed to the potty training of more kids than I can count, both nannying and at a preschool. Nevermind that I spent the the previous year working on potty training with kids who were actually developmentally behind in the area. I don't have kids, which apparently entirely discredited the advice that SHE asked for. I've gotten this so many times over the years, not to the degree of a mother starving her infant to death, but it is one of the most infuriating things about my career. ",

Like, I'm not saying it to be an ass, I'm keeping your fucking kid safe. I have literally watched: * Two kids clothesline themselves on tensabarriers (those rope-in-a-pole things everyone likes to undo and pretend they didnt) because they were running when I told them not to. * A kid smack their head on a counter running on a wet floor with a sign up after I told them not to. * A kid lick a soda fountain nozzle after being told to get off the counter. * A kid fall off the counter after being told to get off the counter. * A kid get their finger stuck in a hole after being told not to poke the hole in the counter. * A kid attempt to reach into my register, and the parent bitched at me for telling the kid to get off my counter and stay out of my drawer. * A kid running on a leash because mom got tired of holding it and let go. * A kid pilfering other people's snacks. * A kid vomit on me, the carpet, and themselves when I tried to warn the parent (same kid that licked the soda nozzle). * A kid fall down the fucking stairs because their parents were letting them run amok in the rapidly filling theater. * Kids getting their parents to buy them tickets to movies that had a hard R rating (like *Savages*, which has sex like every ten minutes), complaining they have to sit with the kids, then complaining about the content of the film. *That's why we make you sit in the film, idiot, so that you know what your shitbird 13 year old got you to buy them a ticket to.* Each time one of these happened, the parent asked if I had kids, and when I said no, told me not to tell them how to raise theirs. Cue accident/incident on camera, threat to sue to theater because I didn't tell them not to be assholes, cameras proving I did, removal from theater without refund. The only ones I had a modicum of sympathy for were parents who's kids misled them on the nature of the film, but not much because Google is a thing. I may not have kids, but I know that my not having shat out a hellspawn does not mean I don't know when something is a blatantly bad move. ",

Some classrooms were half-day, some were full-day. The full-day classrooms used co-teaching. We had a max capacity for all the classrooms so that there only ever had to be 1 teacher in a classroom at once. We would do split-shifts and split all classroom responsibilities 50/50. Each teacher had their own lesson plan for their half of the day. Kept teachers from getting burnt out during the day, and from having one person getting too overwhelmed with responsibility. It made for some really well-rounded classrooms, as we were able to really focus on their responsibilitities, and for great staff morale.",

While there may not be a shortage in potential waiters, good&reliable ones are valuable and should be paid what they're worth. Staff that feels appreciated puts in extra effort, because it's more than a job. In the same way customers will pay more/return more often if they had a good experience. A good&honest restaurant should have no issues finding business (even if they pay better wages and have higher prices) while commissions won't save a scummy restaurant. I don't like the american system, all it does is let the owner and customers 'fuck over' staff (doesn't matter if they did a poor job) aand it 'socializes' their wage by guilt tripping customers into chipping in. It also fucks other legit businesses because the scummy restaurant has lower staff costs. Finally there are many other jobs that provide vital services, yet don't receive any tips..why do we tip waitstaff, but not the surgeon that saved your life? Which is more important? Last but not least, if you need to rely on paying inhumane wages to make a profitable/economic business, then your business simply shouldn't exist. That's why stuff like enforced livable minimum wages are so important, because otherwise some scumbag will pay less and who has to pay the difference? The public through taxes (for social services) or by guilt tripping people into 'mandatory' tips.",

I can't prove it but i get the feeling the medical workers were a lot more negligent than they told the parents in playing a part in the baby's death than they're letting on. I think the parents, that mom, did the best they could but were mislead to promote a higher \"breastfed\" statistic for the hospital.

Also, our neighbours cat was called \"Knut\", which is a fairly common boys' name in Norway (human name mind you). After \"Knut\" had given birth several times, one certain sharpminded individual startet to question if the cat's name was all that fitting with it clearly not being a male and all. A lot of thought was clearly put in to the matter, because no sooner than a week (!) later, the neighbours' kids proudly announced that the black and white female cat was no longer to be known as \"Knut\".
