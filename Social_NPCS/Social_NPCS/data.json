                    "body": "I was asked by a crying student once if there was a second moon. We were outside for recess and as happens sometimes, the moon was visible. I said Nope, why and she pointed to the moon and asked but aren't the sun and the moon the same thing? 4th grade student, not special needs or anything. She was crying because the other kids were making fun of her for thinking the sun and the moon were the same thing. After I explained to her the sun did not turn into the moon at night and then back into the sun in the morning (she actually thought the moon was the sun 'turned off'), I did an impromptu science lesson that afternoon with the whole class.\n\nETA: Wow, so many responses! \n\nTo clarify, I wasn't a real teacher, just a sub. In my state we are given provisional licenses to substitute teach and are required to have a BA or BS degree (in any field), but no real training or long term license like real teachers have. My training was a 2-hour orientation, then tossed into the pool so to speak. I did many long-term assignments at this particular school and often did day-to-day assignments, and had subbed for this teacher before, so I knew she'd be ok with me going off her plan for the afternoon. Also the kids' 'special' for that afternoon (specials are classes like music, art, gym) was canceled so we had extra time together anyway.\n\nSome pointed out that doing a special science lesson might have singled out the kid even more and/or made her feel bad, but in my experience from subbing all over this district was that when one student didn't know something fundamental, at least half of them also didn't know. I don't mean to malign this district because education standards have plummeted around the country so its not like the district is unique in that regard, and also many of the students came from very challenging backgrounds that affected their education, ability to learn, and so on. So the lesson turned out quite well, I established from the get-go that no question about our solar system was off-limits or dumb and no one was allowed to laugh or make fun of any question. The kids had a lot of fun. \n\nLike I thought many of the kids didn't know fundamental things about our solar system. Turned out the girl in question was not the only one to have confusion over the sun and moon, and many of the children did not even know that the earth revolves around the sun and not the other way around. The majority of the class could not name other planets besides earth and mars, and the majority of the class did not know how seasons work, why a year is the term it is, or why we have leap years, time zones, etc. It was a very fulfilling afternoon for me and them as each question prompted another question and each answer made them light up. The classroom had a smart board so we could pull up and read information together as each question was asked and answered, which they really enjoyed. \n\nAgain not to malign this district, but a big reason the kids were so ignorant was because at this school they simply had not had basic solar system lessons yet...in my day as a child these sort of things were learned in 3rd grade. As a side note, in this district they also do not teach multiplication facts in the 3rd grade; the kids are not required to memorize the times tables at all nor are really taught how to do long division by hand nor are given nearly enough time to learn and understand fractions. This results in all sorts of nonsense when they get to higher math (for example, most of the middle-schoolers and high schoolers could not do math problems at the board because they got stumped when it broke down to multiplying. If they did not have a calculator they could not do it)\n\nSomeone asked how the girl is doing now, I'm sorry to say I have no idea. Like quite a few of the students in this district she moved fairly often so I saw her at other schools from time to time for a few years and then stopped seeing her, so either she moved to a neighborhood in a school I refused to go to anymore or she left the district. She'd be about 10th grade now so I hope she is doing well.\n\nThanks for the comments saying I'm a good teacher, and thanks for the ones saying/implying I wasn't also. I really was not, I didn't have much patience or compassion nor the nerves to deal with many of the changes that happened with education in general in my state nor changes within this district in particular. I subbed for 5 years, and by the end of it my nerves were shot and my mouth had no chill. I intended to become a real teacher; I was in a Masters+ certification program but had a come-to-jesus moment when I realized I simply am not capable of being the effective and caring teacher students deserve. So I had to go. I have no regrets, but I do miss the kids and days like these sometimes.",

Really? It HAD to be the night of the giant presentation she was supposed to do?! I asked her if there was anything special about that date and why it NEEDED to be that night when she was aware that not attending would for sure lock-in her already failing grade for the class. She just shrugged and said it just felt like a good day for her to do it on. She didn't attend the presentations event.

Willard, Commander of U.S. Pacific Command, \"My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize\", to which Admiral Willard replied, \"We don't anticipate that.\"[29][30] Johnson's office later backtracked by saying Johnson is simply a tremendous deadpan and that he was using a facetious metaphor.[31]\n\nThe U.S. military had proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on Guam and moving 8,600 Marines, and 9,000 of their dependents from Okinawa, Japan. Including the required construction workers, this buildup would increase Guam's population by 79,000, or 45%, and the total land the military might control or tenant could grow to or surpass 40% of the entire landmass of Guam. In a February 2010 letter, the United States Environmental Protection Agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall, sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs.[32] By 2012, these plans had been cut to only have a maximum of 4,800 Marines stationed on the island, two thirds of which would be there on a rotational basis without their dependents.[33]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Johnson#Comments_on_Guam_tipping_over\n\nBut t seems like the congressman was the only one discussing the environmental impact of moving marines to the island, which seems like a good cause. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/hV-DzuCPmXU?t=94",

When my grandmother passed away unexpectedly a couple years back, my sister asked her professors if it would be alright to miss a day of class. I think there was a quiz or something scheduled that day. One of them demanded a death certificate as proof. An obit would not suffice. She ended up not going to the funeral at all because of that. It sucks balls that there are kids who have 5 grandparents die during the course of a semester than no one can take other people seriously when they say someone has passed.\n\nEDIT: Since my joke is falling flat, I will explain. 5 grandparents meaning the student didn't keep track of their lies and ended up with more grandparents than the average person which is odd by itself, let alone that they all died within 5 months of each other. Yes, I know that some people have more than 4 grandparents through remarriage. My boyfriend has 6. Yes, I know that some people get very unlucky and have a string of people die in a short amount of time, and I feel incredibly sorry for them.",

That probably seemed really sarcastic. \n\nI actually haven't thought all about this in so long, but I remember actually feeling kinda guilty about it for a bit because it seemed like I hurt his feelings. I mean, needless to say, Im definitely not as naive anymore and I know a lot better now...\n\n...Middle school was such a weird time lmao \n\nEdit: I've been getting some questions about this so here it is. I felt guilty because he looked absolutely rekt and I didn't know why. It was as if I destroyed everything he owned, and everyone was staring and laughing so he seemed so humiliated. He literally fled like a damn pokemon. I felt bad because I'd never seen anything more pathetic in my life. The teachers would tell me to brush it off because, \"he just likes you!\" so I didn't quite understand that it wasn't appropriate at the time because no one told me that it wasn't okay. That was kinda the norm at the time, at least at my school. Oh, the dress code thing. I didn't understand why I couldnt wear tank tops in 98 degree weather when guys could, and got so confused when a teacher told me that my bra strap was showing. One teacher even pulled a girl's bra strap and got in trouble for it. It was a different time, I suppose. \n\nNow I know that he deserved it, and now I don't hesitate to immediately get the authorities involved and I've definitely called the cops for gropings. Glad I know better now, but I do wish that my middle school did better. That's why it's so important for schools to actually teach sex ed and acceptable behavior. At a certain point it's your responsibility but schools have an obligation to lead you in the right way.       ",

(I think) \n\nDid your school happen to have enriched classes or is that a rare thing? \n\nEdit: for those who don't know,  my Ontario high school has 4 levels of classes: Locally Developed, Applied, Academic and Enriched. Most people took Academic classes. Enriched classes (only available for maths sciences english and french) provided an extra challenge. You could only take AP tests if you were taking the corresponding enriched classes. I took enriched everything from grade 9 to 11 and then dropped everything to academic except english and chemistry because of the stress of the enriched environment  (currently grade 12). \n\nEdit 2: Nobody took hard courses once at the Academic/Advanced level in summer school, then retook them the next fall as Enriched. Summer school is basically only used if either you fail or you don't want to take a required class next year (i.e. taking gr. 12 english in summer of gr. 11). Additionally, you can't take Enriched courses in summer school.",

Corn, is a fantastic example.\n\nEdit: This comment has gotten a lot of attention, so I will just say in one place here that I have made the mistake of not citing the difference between GMO and selectively breed food. GMO food can certainly be grown in a way that makes it legally considered organic, but I still stand by my earlier statement that GMO food has no evidence of danger and organic food generally uses more pesticides than non-organic food.

The reason our shit smells bad is that it is the remnants of food that has been rotting inside you. This is perfectly normal and your body is designed to handle it properly. \n\nAs for toxic sludge...if you have toxic sludge in your body, you need to see a physician, not a detox peddler. I'm not even sure what toxic sludge is, but the fact that it's inside you by the pound and not killing you makes me question how \"toxic\" it can be. \n\nThe funniest part is that these detoxes typically include a chemical that makes your poop rubbery and stretchy. That way people think it \"worked.\" Oh my god, that doesn't look like normal poop--it must be the toxic sludge! Yeah, no, it's just that you intentionally ingested a chemical to make your regular poop look like that and probably also another chemical that made you poop a lot at once for dramatic effect. ",

Obviously, spending money you don't have to have a big wedding is bad, but that's just being bad with money and not necessarily specific to weddings, although weddings do tend to cause people to spend more than they would on other things. It's also true that many things are marked up for weddings. However, if it's within your means, what's wrong with spending a bunch of money on a wedding?\n\nI think the high total cost of weddings makes it hard to people to quantify. If you think of it on a smaller scale, imagine 5 of your friends are visiting from out of town and you treat them all to dinner. The bill comes out to $300. You could say $300 is a lot for \"one meal\" but remember, it's for 6 people, and you don't mind paying for all your friends because them coming from out of town is considered a special occasion.\n\nNow scale it up. You want to celebrate an occasion that most people have once in your life and you want to invite all your friends and family to celebrate with you. Sure, $10-15k might be a lot for \"one day\" but remember, you're basically paying for 100+ people's meals, a venue to use, decorations, music, servers, etc. For someone who can afford it, does that sound super unreasonable?\n\nObviously, people shouldn't spend money that's out of their budget to have a big wedding but if it's within your means, why not? Sure, you could have a wedding for less. You could also live without that TV, or the latest smartphone. Some things have different values to different people. If it makes them happy and it's within their means, then what's the harm? For the record, I spent about $15k on my wedding. My spouse and I both have well-paying jobs, we bought a house before the wedding putting 25% down, bought a new car, and still had enough money for a year's worth of mortgage payments, emergencies, etc. When we graduated, we had a plan about what we wanted and budgeted and saved accordingly. Also, while you definitely shouldn't count on it, you do make some of the cost back in wedding gifts.",

If you have shitty photography and your DJ stinks, it's probably not going to be the best day ever. \n\n\nAnd I know you're exaggerating but seat covers are nowhere near that price. ",

The vast majority of illegal immigration happens one of 2 ways.\n\n* Someone enters legally with a visa and stays longer than their visa allows.\n* Someone crosses the border and immediately gives up to ICE and claims they are persecuted in their home country/city and claims asylum.  They would be taken into custody for a week to a month then released.  They are then given a court date to review their asylum application.  Because the system is so backed up the court date may be 2-3 years in the future to which they would be allowed to live legally within the USA.  Then they potentially never show up to the court date and simply stay.\n\nIn both cases they are documented and in theory we have information on these people. People who immigrate illegally to the USA are not stupid they talk to each other.  One of the main reasons they know they can get away with this is the fact that Federal officials rarely track down people who overstay their visa and actually deport them.  They'd rather spend the resources to go after those people who have done criminal acts.\n\nIf you wanted to actually stop illegal immigration you would take a multi prong approach.\n\n* Allow a mechanism for illegals to exit the country without any penalty.\n* Hire more ICE officers, and randomly deport non-criminal people.  This will strike fear into the hearts of millions of illegals where they might leave of their own accord.\n* Pass a law similar to Alabama's HB 56.  Which made it especially inhospitable for illegals to remain.  Now there were many problems with this law, but the general idea to make it very inhospitable for illegals to work, live, go to school etc.  Make it required to have proof of citizenship to buy a car, rent an apartment/house, enroll in school etc.\n* Crack down on employers who hire illegal workers.  Right now there are simply fines or no penalizes at all.  If you made it a criminal offense this would deter any legal organization to hire such workers.\n\nIt's worth noting that I'm not really advocating for this course of action.  The implications would be enormous, quite possibly pushing the USA into a recession.\n\n* Such enforcement and hiring thousands of ICE workers, judges, etc to deport would be hugely expensive, maybe the same or more than building a wall.\n* Industries like farming, meatpacking, construction would be devastated.  When Alabama HB 56 was passed many farms could not find sufficient US Workers to pick their fields at any price.  It's possible this long term spurs on innovation to pick fields using robots or something.  The likelihood of these ever being good paying jobs is pretty slim.\n* You'd create a huge vacuum of low wage unfilled jobs.  Even if these industries offer higher wages it's probable that these positions will remain largely unfilled.  Leading to massive lost productivity.\n* Most likely some cities/states would resist such changes and do as much as they can to not comply with the laws.  Most likely some of these cities/states would challenge the laws in court.\n* Real estate prices might see a collapse.  As illegals move out or are deported it would likely free up huge amounts of housing.\n* You'd lose out on billions of economic activity from these people who buy good and services, pay sales taxes, property taxes (indirectly), etc. \n* You'd create a huge rift in the Hispanic community.  Creating such fear of deportation likely would lead to those groups not trusting Police even to the point of possibly not reporting crimes even if they are here legally.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!",

Take pulled pork as an example. *Very* easy to make, but if you look at a recipe you need a handful of spices for the rub, some vinegar, worcestershire, and other random shit for the sauce. $30 later, you're ready to make pulled pork. If you cook often it's no big deal, you're building out a pantry. If you're just putting your toe in the water then that's pretty overwhelming. Blue Apron type services are more expensive but you get everything you need at a predictable price. ",

This is a huge problem in the ag and service industry. 67,000 H2 visas are granted every year but most of them are grabbed by landscaping companies.\n\nProblem is, while farmers and ranchers do have some use for year-round employees (edit: the large majority of those are usually legal immigrants or U.S. citizens), they need a lot more hands in the warmer months. Sometimes they need 20 times their usual workforce for a couple of weeks.\n\nThere are no programs for this. Zero. (Edit: There used to be one up to the 50s, the bracero program. While not perfect, it addressed exactly this, but it was killed off by unions. Many braceros stayed in the U.S. and became de facto illegals, but the bottomline is that no program ever replaced it, while U.S. workers moved into manufacturing or grey or white collar jobs, leaving ag jobs behind.) So, many of those ag workers are illegal. They work that farm or that ranch, then move to another one, and so on. Same in the hospitality industry in some places.\n\nMany of them come through H2 visas that don't get renewed by the employer, so they stay here. Many come illegally. And so on.\n\nBack around 2012 several Southern states passed anti-immigration laws allowing for instance local LE to arrest undocumenteds and hand them over to ICE (sometimes violating basic Fourth Amendment rights). Farmers in some of those states couldn't find labor and lost millions - those laws were struck down in court or slowly rolled back.\n\nRight now there's a shortage of labor in Midwestern dairy farms. They can't find enough workers to prune West Coast orchards and vineyards. Do you think local unemployed people apply for those jobs, even though they pay minimum wage or more? Fuck no.\n\nFix the system. Then you can enforce it.",

And for those people, they would be better off taking the specific vitamins they need rather than the multivitamin.  \n\nMost multivitamins are made in such a way that your body doesn't actually get advantage from most of the ingredients. You will get a much better effect from taking a liquid capsule of the specific vitamins you need.\n\nAlso, multivitamin doses are often low where some things like D3 the newer research indicates much higher doses to get good results (My doctor told me to be taking like 5000 units of D, a multivitamin might have 250)\n\nMultivitamins also can mess one up, because you can get too much of stuff that you aren't deficient in. Its also pretty easy to OD on something like Iron (especially for 40+ year old men, who eat meat, who should take an Iron free supplement, because Iron is strongly correlated with Heart issues). Folic acid is one where getting the vitamin does, plus getting some through food can cause issues which ultimately lead to cancer. \n\nIn the end, its obviously best to get vitamins naturally through nutrition, exercise, and sunlight. And a multivitamin is better than nothing. But if you really need something specific, don't rely on Centrum. \n\nhttp://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/02/econundrums-do-vitamin-supplements-work\n\n",

We got unlimited engagement photo shoots (he went around with us to a bunch of locations and took shots and touched them all up for free) and then had him and his wife there for 8+ hours until mid way through the reception.  He then picked out a bunch of \"top\" pictures and ran them by us and then did FULL touching up/photo altering to make them look fantastic.  We got those as well as EVERY image he took for us and have full rights to them.  He was phenomenal and really helped make it an amazing experience.  \n\nNow on the other hand the trolley we rented instead of a limo was a massive disappointment.  Didn't get most of our \"wedding package\" and the driver was very quiet and uninterested in us.  If I could go back and NOT drop the cash for a 'just married' trolley to drive us around town I would definitely do so.  \n\nTop three things we don't regret spending on -\n\n1. Photographer\n2.

They did it by distributing your payments pro rata across all items you were renting, so by their accounting you never paid any one item off until you paid everything off at the same time.\n\nLike I said, I don't think that is legal anymore, so it's kinda like a high interest loan, which is shitty but not quite as exploitative as it used to be.",

We do buy a couple of things at a premium (eggs & milk mainly) for ethical reasons, but we don't buy meat and we try to get a lot of produce from the farmer's market.  \n\nIn case people don't believe me, here's a normal day for me:\n\n- Breakfast is an english muffin (4.29 for a pack of 6) and a banana (3.35 for 8), plus a bit of butter (maybe a dime's worth). I also drink a cup of coffee (~.20 cents).  That's about ~1.50 for breakfast, which isn't too bad.  I get somewhere around 250 calories from that.  \n\n- Lunch is often leftovers so that's hard to compute, but if I'm doing an actual lunch, I might eat some yogurt (~0.60), a pickle (~0.50), a salad (~$2.25 once everything is included), and a piece of fruit (~0.60).  That lunch is ~4.00 and will get me somewhere in the ballpark of 600 calories.  \n\n- For snacks for the day, I might eat a cheese stick (.30 cents), some pretzels (.20 cents worth), a piece of fruit (.60 cents), and a pickle (.50 cents).  That's about $1.60, and yields me about 300 calories.  \n\n- For dinner, I can use my chili, which actually has a fairly low cost-per-serving recipe.  ~$20 yields me right around 8 servings, so about $2.50 each.  I generally add some sour cream, onion, and cheese, which combine to about $.50 cents, so $3.00 for the meal.  That nets me about 500 or 600 calories.  \n\nAdding that all together, a pretty basic day would cost me at least $10 and net about 1750 calories.  Unfortunately, I work out 6 days a week, burning anywhere between 300-600 calories and even on a diet my calorie requirements are usually in the 2600-3000 range, so I do have to eat more.  If I were to really cost out what a normal day looks like, I spend closer to $15 on food.  \n\nIf I'm spending $15 and my girlfriend is spending $10 on food, that's $175/week on groceries without a lot of overindulgence. \n\nYes, there are definitely areas we can save, but it's not like we're eating saffron-coated truffles either.  I can switch from eating apples (~.60 per apple) to eating more bananas (~.20 per banana), replace a lot of my fruit/veggie calories with starches and carbs, and more aggressively hunt for deals, but I feel that it would be less healthy and life would be less enjoyable.  \n\n\n",

If you have clinical depression there is something physically wrong with you - it's not \"all in your head\" the problem is in your physical, literal, brain. A diabetic takes insulin everyday and nobody cries that they're \"dependent on medicine\" to survive, so it's high time we stop saying that about people with mental illnesses.\n\nMy problem was that my brain doesn't uptake endorphins. So all the exercise, sunshine and clean eating the world wouldn't have \"snapped me out of it\" because no matter how many endorphins I produced my body couldn't utilize them. Other people can have a problem production - so lifestyle changes will help. If you're asking because you are depressed, try lots of things.

Like, suicidal. I did these steps one by one over a long period of time. That's what I recommend you do as well. \n\nEDIT: If you want to follow my advice, I recommend foremost that you seek professional help as well.\n\n1. I started running. It took me about a month until I realized, \"Hey... I haven't been hit with the strong urge to kill myself in a long time!\" I do it more for the mental benefits than for the physical benefits. A sedentary lifestyle will not be nice to you. Seriously, exercise.\n\n2. I used to panic about everything until I started meditating. Now I'm a pretty chill dude. Sometimes stressful things happen to me, but I can always handle it without getting really upset.\n\n3. I cut sugar out of my diet (mostly). This was partly to lose weight, but I noticed I felt a lot better after I did so. I had more energy, I was happier, it was great.\n\n4. I decided I would try to get a good sleep every night. Being not super sleepy all the time was great, and it actually has a lot of mental benefits. Check out some sleep cycle timers.\n\n5. I stopped eating fast food. It's just terrible for you mentally and physically.\n\n6. I stopped watching porn. I was just addicted to it, I had a harder time getting aroused the more often I did it, and I knew of the benefits of stopping, so I mustered up the willpower to do it. I have no regrets.\n\n7. I started using a memory palace to study for my tests. Basically, to memorize things, you store them in your \"memory palace\", which is usually your house. I have a sub-par memory, but now I can recall my notes almost word for word and it's helped me so damn much on my tests. [Alex Mullen has a good video on how to do this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw4x_Ijoz1M&list=PL5fi_YS6Tf7gUhJadaDWXg8D3byXibXD7&index=1)\n\nI still have a long way to go, namely in losing weight and socializing, but I'm a pretty happy guy right now. I don't know how helpful this advice would be to other people with depression, but I thought I'd share it. Hopefully it can help someone :)",

However you can do things with your thoughts. You've got to learn to recognize destructive thought patterns, and remember that they're just in your mind. If you're thinking that everyone hates you, pick specific people and question yourself:\nDoes Bob really hate me? What possible reason could he have for that? He was shitty with me the other day. Why? People have bad days, he was probably just having a bad day. Has he ever said anything to me that implies he hates me? No, he's usually very pleasant, it was just that one time he was pissed off and that's what made me feel bad. OK, Bob doesn't hate me.\nYou can do this with any situation. Analyse it slowly and logically and you'll see that a lot of the bad stuff you think has happened is mainly down to your assumptions. You can't assume that other people think badly of you for a start.\nAlso, you have to force yourself to see people you like, people who like you. Every second in the company of friends and loved ones, even if you feel like shit, is gold. Remind yourself constantly that the people around you care, they think that you matter. It is an effort of will even to show up, get out of bed, whatever. You're not doing it to make yourself happier, you're doing it to show your inner mind why you should be happier.\nFinally, talk to someone. Trust me that somebody in your life gives enough of a shit to listen to you. It may be the last person you imagine. If you can't find that someone, there are many professionals. Talking something out is incredibly helpful. It's not a cure, but it can really help lead you back to healthier thoughts. Go to your GP/MD/local walk in clinic. There are charities like the Samaritans who are there just to listen. Nobody with an ounce of caring in them will judge you or think worse of you. You're showing some serious strength by facing up to your depression. You're also showing a great amount of respect to whomever you confide in.",

My depression is not noticeable - I'm not sad all the time per se, but suffer from extremely intrusive thoughts that cause my moods to dip and me to retreat interpersonally. I would go for long walks and spend the whole time imagining how it would go if my boyfriend told me he had cheated on me (which is totally not the reality) and reveling in the pain of imaginging us breaking up over it. I would self sabatoge in not letting myself fully commit to achieving my highest quality work (procrastination), and could get by, but always treading water.\n\nJust telling the people who mattered the most to me made me feel better - they couldn't even tell I had been this way for years - from probably 15years old to where I am now, 27 and in graduate school. I always thought I was just morbid and lazy, but my depression was a form of self-limitation. Oh, and I exercised frequently from when I was 19 and now. Turns out depression runs in women on my maternal side. My great grandma subjected to electro shock therapy in the 70s. My grandma wont admit her problems, but my mom takes a small dose of prozac every day. Knowing these self-limitations were not my fault but genetic, was such a relief. I felt compelled to see a psychiatrist and Wellbutrin (dopamine! not an ssri, no side effects whatsoever for me) has been a wonderful supplement to me. It hasn't changed my life, but makes my moods more stable, no more intrusive thoughts, and projects get done consistently not the night before. I had to go a week without it on accident when I went on a trip two weeks ago, and it wasn't externally noticeable in my behavior til I would get sad at the end of the day and doubt my boyfriend's feelings for me.\n\nJournaling and being introspective and honest about my feelings helps a lot too.

I never wanted to \"bother anyone,\" but my mom is so good at reminding me, \"thank you for allowing me to be there for you.\" People who love you WANT to help, and we can't survive on our own with depression.\n\nA hard part for me is that one true treatment is to JUST DO THINGS. But even to shower, to eat, to go outside, they all feel impossible, yet just doing them is the cure (for me). And I couldn't ever \"just do it.\" So I'd call a loved one and ask them to talk me though having breakfast, or talk to me while I walk around the block. I needed (and still need) help to get me going, and people want to help.  \n\nThe other true treatment, I've found, in conjunction to our physical actions, is our thoughts. Retraining your brain is hard work, but it's the brain work I do daily that helps me maintain a healthy mental state. Talking positive to myself and dismissing negative thoughts, all day long, is the hard work that pays off in time. I specifically worked with therapists trained in DBT, and paired with medication, I have been able to create new mental habits of thinking and talking kindly to myself. I used to think about killing myself everyday, and so I actively and consciously responded to those thoughts with self- loving and positive thoughts. It was/ IS hard, and felt stupid, and was exhausting, but slowly I got used to not believing those suicidal thoughts, and the response of positive thoughts has become automatic. I've told myself that I love myself so many times, I actually believe it now. Depression never truly goes away for me, but I continue to maintain positive mental habits to keep me functional.\n\nI admire you opening up to hear from others. You're awesome.",

I didn't need to lose weight or anything I just liked animals and thought it wouldn't hurt to see if I could try to go without eating them as often. Surprisingly it felt good, and it felt good when I had meat again too after a while so the moderation thing is true. I learned to cook over that time both with and without meat and you learn to appreciate both sides of the tale.  \n  \nSocially, I began going out as often as possible with friends and people I found friendly. Don't be shy to tell people you're looking for people to hang out with. In fact, be so bold as to tell people \"You're a cool dude/chick. We're going to be friends. What are you doing this weekend?\" I didn't go to clubs or anything, but out to eat, to watch the game, to have some drinks,  go to an exhibit, to see a movie, just about anything. When I wasn't doing that I was reading or watching documentaries so I could learn new things because I found the more I knew the more I had to say. Slowly I got to know more people and then I met a girl and that changed a lot. I wasn't ever really shy but I was uninterested in speaking to others yet the more I could kind of entertain myself by trying to find something, anything to talk about when I was with others I began to have fun. It became kind of like a game of what do this person and I have in common and how can I get there and then I would casually ask them questions trying to solve the mystery. From there it was just happiness all around because I was keeping my mind busy, my heart was happy, and I was feeling healthy as well.  I don't really get the downs as often now but sometimes randomly I'll be driving and suddenly it'll hit me.  \n  \nI'll feel like there's a pit in my stomach, a lump in my throat, and something is wrong. I usually call my girlfriend or text her and think about how lucky I am for what I have and that it could be a lot worse than being depressed. I could be starving, I could be poor like third world country poor, I could be without my health or limbs,  I could be a lot of things worse than depressed basically. Even though I may not feel that way in the moment I do know the moment will pass from experience now and happiness will still be around if I care to look for it and when I can't find it I have to stay on course and trust that it will find me. Also, it's important to remember that this depression is a hill and not a mountain. The grandness I give the depression is all in my head and truly nothing is wrong when stop to add everything up but the truth is sometimes even that doesn't do the work but anythings better than the pills in my case. Marijuana helps too. ",

Mind you, I had no idea how therapy worked but it just didn't feel right to me. \nI left and looked for another psychologist. Why? I'll never know because I was just done. \nAnyway, things with this new psychologist worked from the get go. It was very, very hard...but it started to change everything in my life. I started going out a little bit more, I started exercising, I started studying again... until I got stuck. My psychologist told me that it was time for me to try anti depressants. I was not a happy camper. I went to my psychiatrist and started taking my meds. \n\nOne year after starting my treatment and still seeing psychologist a couple of times a month I can tell you that I'm doing great! My life has changed 100% and I do not regret having the courage to admit that I was way over my head and that I needed professional help. \nSo, while exercise and healthy eating/sleeping habits are fundamental for basically everyone, reach out, ask for help if things get too overwhelming.

By this I mean I've always thought happiness is having a ton of friends, going out all the time, etc. Personally, I'm good with my handful of friends and I don't need constant stimulation but I always thought I was inadequate because I wasn't partying or going to bars/clubs/concerts/what have you every weekend. \n\n2) Exercise. This is still a work in progress for me, as I've just started going regularly within the past couple weeks. But I've noticed a huge improvement in my mood and the stability of my mood.\n\n3) Having a solid support system. I only have a handful of friends, but the friends I have are damn good and I know I can count on them for anything. I'd rather that than a ton of acquaintances.\n\n4) Following my passion and living up to my own expectations. I'm a college student and always thought I wanted to be a doctor until I realized I fucking hated all of the classes I was taking. Now I'm studying stuff I love and my future (though I think I know what I want to do) is wide open.\n\n5) Reduction of social media, namely Facebook. Nothing better than Facebook to make you feel inadequate when it's a platform for people to show only the shiniest aspects of their life.",

First and foremost I NEED to take my medication.  No if ands or buts about it.  I have a legitimate mental illness and no amount of \"positive thinking\" or yoga is going balance my chemical imbalance...this isn't to say positive thinking and yoga do not HELP-they are great as adjuncts-but on their own will be completely useless to me when I am so suicidally depressed I can't even find the motivation to get out of bed.  SSRIs/SNRIs-they have literally saved my life.  I will take them indefinitely if I want to live any sort of \"quality\" existence.\n\n2. Exercise.  The more, the better.  Anything that gets my endorphins pumping.  I prefer running as I find it most enjoyable. 45 minutes to an hour each day.  Taking meds alone enables me to get out of bed in the morning and be functional...exercise (as rigorous as running is and for the length of time I mentioned) allows me to actually LOOK FORWARD to waking up and starting my day. I feel genuine HAPPINESS.  It also is an amazing stress and anxiety reliever.\n\n3. Food.  Tons of fruits and vegetables. The less processed crap I consume the better I feel.  Eating well just helps everything else to work better.\n\n4. Sleep.  I cannot stress enough how important good \"sleep hygeine\" is in staving off depression.  Everyone is a little different, but I find that I generally feel well rested with 5-8 hours of sleep each night.  I recently began waking up earlier (and going to bed earlier) and it has made such a positive difference (I used to sleep until 1PM each day and stay up until 3 or 4 in the morning).  If you work night shift, do whatever is humanly possible to get off that shift-graveyard shift can make even \"normal\"people depressed...and if you already suffer from depression it is one of the worst things you can do to yourself (trust me, I speak from experience).\n\n5. Meditation.  If I meditate consistently I am so much more relaxed and anxiety-free in general.  I used to suffer panic attacks-six months of daily meditation helped tremendously in stopping them.\n\nLastly I would like to mention that surrounding yourself with positivity-whatever makes you feel good about yourself or life in general, be it books, music, movies, animals-whatever-is really going to help create a better mind set once you begin to feel better.  For myself it was hard at first because I was so used to thinking in negatives all the time--I used to actively search out things that made me sad...but once I got in the practice of thinking more positively (this is in addition to all of the above...trying to \"think positive\" without meds etc. only pissed me off) I discovered a world I never knew existed.\n\nI hope I have been able to help.  I am in my early 40's and have been dealing with depression most of my life, so I have a bit of experience under my belt in the area.  Good luck to all reading this. :)",

When I stop listening to music, playing guitar or cooking, I realise I'm getting bad.

Never talked back, very well behaved, didn't want to play with other children and preferred to be alone. I was depressed. \n\nMy life wasn't the worst, but it wasn't easy either. When I was 7 or 8 my dad showed me his dick and asked me if I wanted to play with it. I told my babysitter, who told my mom, who did nothing about it. She said she left my dad because of it, but that wasn't for a good year so I don't believe it. \n\nMy dad beat the living shit out of my mom when I was 8 years old. I was over at my neighbours house and my bestfriend rode his bike past my place, saw that my mom was bleeding on the steps of our house and crying. He came and told me, I confirmed what he saw myself and went back to my friend's house to tell their parents. My dad came over to my friend's house and asked me if I wanted to go for ice cream with him or stay at my friend's house. Now I love ice cream, always have, and I love hanging out with my dad... but I was able to put two and two together and realize he did that to my mom so I said I wanted to stay. He was really asking if I wanted to come live with him or stay with my mom. I remember the look on his face when I said I wanted to stay. \n\nMy mom became a raging alcoholic, drinking 4-5 nights a week at least and I watched her do this to herself for years. After 5 years of this shit, after 5 years of watching her be a functioning alcoholic, I snapped. I got so fucking tired of being sad, of crying, of begging God to take it all away. I decided I hated God, that I didn't believe in him and no God would make a child go through this much pain. \n\nI started cutting when I was 13. I started trying to commit suicide when I was 13. First time I did it I took an entire bottle of Tylenol. I went to sleep figuring I would die. I woke up puking up the pills. Called my mom, since I had been unsuccessful and obviously needed to go to the hospital. Went to the hospital, wasn't pumped because I had puked most of it up. That was my first stay in the psych ward.\n\nI went to the psych ward two more times over the course of two years. Suicide attempts.\n\nMy mother never stopped drinking, to this day she drinks and now I'm stuck living with her again.\n\nI cut from when I was 13 until I was 23. That would be 3 years after having my son. I didn't cut while I was pregnant, but being a single mother with absolutely no help from anyone save for a few weekends here or there, I was stressed to the nines. When my son was 3 years old I slapped him in the face for whatever reason. I remember standing there after it happened and watching him cry, feeling like a total monster. A lot of shit had lead up to this point, but I thought to myself... I made him cry, I did this, how can I make him feel better when I'm the problem? I called up his dad and told him to take our son. I didn't want to be a mother anymore.\n\nI felt like I had completely failed. I was abusing my child physically, the spanking had gotten out of control and I was losing it frequently. Screaming non stop, not knowing what to do with myself or how to even raise a child.\n\nI used to spend hours, HOURS and hours sitting infront of my computer, just crying. I was so miserable. I used to wonder how it was possible for somebody to cry this much for this long and not run out of water in their body. \n\nI remember one night when I had my son, everything went well. We had a good day, had a good night and I put him to bed no problem after a bath and a book. I walked out of the bedroom, and slowly, step by step sank onto the ground in my living room and just started crying. I was sobbing heavily and for absolutely NO reason. Nothing had happened to trigger this. I was just an absolute mess.\n\nSo, there I was. 23, childless now and a complete failure. I was a cutter, I was suicidal, I was an abusive parent and I figured alright. This is it. I'm going to kill myself. I took to the internet to research how to kill myself. I figured a cocktail of something to put me to sleep, something to kill me and something to dull the pain would do. I started figuring out what this cocktail would be. 3 weeks later I hadn't spoken to my son, but he called. He was crying and saying he missed me. How could he miss me? I've been so terribly awful to him, how can he still love me? But he did. So I decided I couldn't kill myself. I had waited too long and if I was going to do it I should have done it when he was a baby and written out a will as to who he would go to [my mother]. I decided I had fucked up, and now I was stuck here whether I liked it or not. So I called my local doctor and went in for an appointment. I told him most of what had been going on and told him how I felt and asked him to refer me to mental health services. He did and I got in to see a counselor. Spoke to her, and although I hated her because she was a judgemental cunt, I got in to see the psychiatrist. He was very rude, asked me what I wanted out of this and I said I need a diagnosis and pills to help with my depression. He gave me a prescription for risperidone and told me I had borderline personality disorder. I had heard that before, from a movie or something. But never looked in to it. I always assumed I had severe depression, nothing more. \n\nBorderline personality disorder made a lot of sense for me. The pills hit me like a truck the first week or two, I felt weird, I was insanely tired even though I was on a very small dose and I was just unavailable to do anything in the real world. I went back to my doctor with my diagnosis that was faxed to him and asked him to fill out forms for me to be put on disability, because before this I was struggling to get by on welfare, unable to work due to my condition. He agreed that I should be put on disability and filled out the paper work for me. One month later, I was approved. Usually takes 6-9 months, but for whatever reason they approved me immediately. \n\nFrom there, my life slowly started to get better. I started taking my son for a few days a week, and slowly learned how to be a better person. My uncle died that same year, crack related heart attack. My son found him in the bedroom when he went upstairs to grab him to drive him to daycare. He came down and told my mom 'uncles sleeping on the floor with his eyes open'. It's been 3 years and my son still cries about that from time to time. He was the only real father figure my son had really had, his father wasn't involved and fought me about taking him at every turn. \n\nSo slowly I started learning how to be a parent. I decided to stop spanking my son almost entirely and slowly stopped spanking him entirely. I figured out that the only reason I was spanking him was because I didn't know what else to do. I hadn't even been raised being spanked... maybe for a few years, but that was it. I was never beaten, just yelled at. Yet I turned to this for my own child.\n\nI still scream constantly, but I'm now working on that too. \n\nI found that pills helped me. And I was a person who never, ever wanted to take pills again because I had taken them as a teen and they made me more suicidal, more on edge and cut way worse than I was so I swore off of them. But I have an imbalance. I need pills to get through my day without being ridiculously miserable. \n\nMy mom is still abusive. She was calling me a welfare mother just the other week, says I do the bare minimum for my son... but honestly, I'm just doing the best I can and I'm proud of myself for that. I know I try hard. I sleep too much, I smoke weed and I don't read to my son every night anymore... but I think I'm an okay mother now.\n\n<cont>",

Besides going to a doctor and working with them to find medication that works for you specifically, there are definitely a few things that stand out as helpful actions.\n\n* Working Out\n\nDoesn't even mean going to the gym.  As long as you're getting your blood pumping it will help even if just a little bit.  It helps me not dwell on depressing bullshit, it gets me out of isolation, and it encourages other healthy habits like,\n\n* Eating\n\nFor me, personally, I tended to starve myself while depressed.  So I started needing the energy from food to physically exert myself, which also started to combat the feelings of malnutrition that would worsen the depression.  Another pretty common sense one that is surprisingly hard to manage is\n\n* Sleeping well\n\nSleeping too much or too little really fucks with you.  It fucks with you even more if you deal with mental illness shit.  Also recently found out that I have sleep apnea and getting this treated helped immensely.\n\nI think a good summation is: by finding ways to take care of your body.  Depression can really push you towards letting your body deteriorate and even when you start getting medication or otherwise treated for it, your body is in a physical state that exacerbates depression and encourages habits that prolong depression.  So managing those is, at least in my case, tantamount to the professional treatment.",

The very first thing I did was to decide to get out of bed every morning. The depression was so severe that it was a daily struggle. But I set that goal and I was determined to achieve it.\n\nLittle by little I started setting other small, completely obtainable goals. I would brush my teeth that day. I would take a shower that day. I would eat something that day. Little by little doing those little self care things built up momentum for me. \n\nEventually it became bigger goal. I would get dressed that day, I would go outside that day, I would walk around my building that day. I was racking up wins and focusing more on the positives, the fact that I was actually DOING something instead of laying in bed wasting away.\n\nI still set most of those little goals everyday. I'm going to wake up, get out of bed, get ready for work, drive safely and arrive at work on time. Before my work day has even started I get to claim a few wins. Everything I accomplish becomes a win, and I slowly over time shifted  my thought pattern of feeling like shit all the time to feeling like I was accomplishing small but important things all the time.\n\nWhenever I hit a roadblock or start feeling down I tell myself, \"I am going to throw a W (win) on the board before I do anything else.\"\n\nThat could be as small as fixing a chipped manicure to vacuuming my store or home, or even just sending a compliment to a friend that day. Anything positive is a win, and all wins go in the W column, and I do a lot more winning than losing.\n\nTL;DR I started thinking about what I was doing right versus what I was doing wrong, 6 years later this is still working and I haven't been depressed like that since.",

                    "body": "Hi first time posting on Reddit  because this is important even if nobody sees it, it helps to actually write it down and to share with others. So I was officially diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and GAD a year ago. And that really helped kickstart the changes. I self-diagnosed myself 4 years before but never sought help. Before I went in thought that I was a waste of oxygen and thought/did very little at all in my life. During this time I gained about 50 pounds and couldn't stand to look at myself anymore.  My normal schedule was go class/work do the bare minimum to get by then play videogames for hours. A year and a half ago I finally went in for professional help. Get it even if u don't think it's helping just talking with another person who has no alternative motives but to help u helps. \n\nI didn't really start improving myself  until the diagnosis which made it much more real to me. After school ended that semester I started to exercise daily and start picking up hobbies that made me happy like music and drawing/designing stuff. \n\nDon't set your expectations too high or you might burn yourself out from everything you are trying to accomplish just little bits here and there everyday will go a long way. The hard part is doing it everyday and then the results begin to show.\n\nKeeping myself busy really helped me control my thoughts and making my thoughts more positive. It really is that simple once I had started doing all these tasks I was setting for myself they just became habit. Exercising is definitely a must; take it slow at first don't expect to much. Exercising helps me feel prepared to take on whatever is in my day and the euphoria from is unparalleled. Didn't mention it earlier but I also had a big tobacco problem and exercising has helped me kick it been clean for 3 months now. \n\nThe last thing I did was remove the toxic from my life. I had a lot of friends who were just like me and still are; I still interact with them,  but it's limited. It's hard to go back to a mindset like that where all there is after school/work is escapism. This also goes for the people that tried bringing me down or were not all that supportive. In retrospective, this approach was very selfish. My issue was I was putting others before myself and was suffering/neglecting myself due to this. I still play video games a little bit; it's a good way to take a break. Overwatch/binding of Isaac are perfect for these short breaks. \n\nAnother thing is those worthless/I can't do anything thoughts just thinking I can or even saying it has helped. On the same not don't set high expectations for stuff in general especially if you have to convince yourself to do it. While I wouldn't say I'm completely clear from depression I have never felt more alive than I do now and am much more optimistic about my future even with the uncertainties.\n\nTwo shows which I found very therapeutic and reflective of myself were bojack horseman and NGE. I watched bojack before I started to improve but bojack taught me that if you keep doing the same thing and expect the result to change or people to help you I.e. be sympathetic, then you are crazy if you continue to do so. October I began watching a episode of NGE a day and watched EoE at the end of the month. EoE is my favorite movie of all time. I saw myself in Shinji and followed his journey through the series and came to the same realization that he did. That there is a future for anyone and that a future without others/pain & suffering wouldn't be worth losing yourself. \n\nTl;dr: I had to recognize my self-hatred/unhappiness and use that to take steps to improve myself physically and mentally. Don't expect anything from anyone because they either don't care or have their own stuff to deal with. You need to initiate it and be the change. There are many methods that can help with depression you just need to take the chance to see if it'll actually help.",

You can make attempts to will yourself to the gym, and just go to the therapist to tell him about it, it will do absolutely no harm (unless your health-care is no good)**.\n\n\nQuick note: There is no such thing as \"Formerly depressed\".\n\nDepression is a cancer. It goes into remission, but it's always there, waiting. Relapses are no fun. That's the worst of it. One day I'm in my backyard, literally crying over how impossibly pretty and yellow that tree's leaves are, then not much later I'm in bed and I can't even care about not wanting to get out ever again.\n\nAnyway, I went to a professional. I'm slightly disappointed that the top two comments are \"I just went to the gym, lol\", because for many depressions, that's like trying to treat a brain aneurysm with chemotherapy. Depression is a broad definition of something we don't *really* understand. We often don't understand the causes, we don't understand the mechanisms involved, we don't even understand our treatments, or why sometimes we don't need any. There's massive work going into improving psychopharmacology and other therapies such as CBT, but for professionals dealing with depressed individuals, the world is dark and they're trying to pin a tail on an invisible donkey, and the tail has no pin.\n\nI understand you see the \"*I just one day decided to go to the gym! JUST DO IT!*\" and get hyped and motivated, but it doesn't always work that way. When you visit a good professional, the first thing he tries is the gym. Then if you have difficulties, he might suggest you just go to the gym, then straight back without entering. Still difficulties? He'll tell you to put on your shoes to go to the gym, then go do something else, then take the shoes back off.\n\nEventually, it might turn out that when you think of putting on your shoes, you just don't leave the bed anymore, or you'll reach for your shoes and just start crying and collapse into a ball of shit on the floor. He'll try different approaches from there.\n\nBefore I finally up and called a therapist I kept hammering things like \"I'm going to the gym, fuck it\", and I'd always end up back in bed hating how I was weak and envying these people who \"made it\" for their strength of will, and that is sad because once I got a bit of help, I realized I had great strength. \n\nThe first medication that worked *for me* (or maybe they didn't because we can't eliminate the possibility of placebo) demolished my depression, caused the mentioned \"crying at tree\" incident (and more like it over the course of a year), made me love books and math and programming and made me tremendously socially awkward. The second time I got out I didn't like reading and math at all, still don't. I'm wood- and metalworking now. I'm also absurdly outgoing and spontaneous, and while I just as often get blank stares and confusion at any jokes I throw the cashier at the supermarket, responses to inquiries from strangers always have my brain instantly clicking into a response, where before I'd stammer and just be a general awkward kid.\n\nI manage relapse-risk also. I write and meditate (scary word, it's just breathing) daily. Also mindfulness. Whenever I find myself standing around, waiting for the shower to get hot enough, waiting for water to boil, anything, I think of my day/week and try to absorb my emotional response to anything I have done or will do. I pretty much started accidentally practicing Buddhism!\n\nFunnily enough, while not currently experiencing the symptoms of depression, I've yet to get myself to go for a nice run. Not because of any mental disability, but because I'm being lazy. I like that I get to be lazy, it means I'm not depressed.",

I got quiet and realized. . . she was right. There was nothing in my past that was a goal of mine that I got to accomplish with my own will, hardwork and determination.

Going to therapy or taking medication because someone else thinks you need to is not the same as admitting to yourself that you need help.\n\n2. Finding the right therapist and going consistently. Once I found the right person I started to see really amazing improvements. Therapy/counseling entered my life when I was in elementary school, but it never helped much until last year when I found my personal perfect therapist. \n\n3. Exercise. I've gone through phases mostly consisting of rock climbing, running, and yoga. I've discovered as long as I'm doing SOMETHING active I experience fewer symptoms/episodes. When I stop I can feel myself get more symptomatic. \n\n4. Social supports. I am fortunate enough to have an amazing mother and a particularly incredible friend. During times of acute crisis my mom has come to my rescue and my friend opens his home as a place to respite. Once he let me live with him for two weeks! \n\n5. Self compassion.

I would run daily but it became an obsession and I became severely under weight. I did counseling every other week for nearly 3 years and also took medication. It put me in a place where I was able to eventually get off medication. If nothing is working for you and you are worried about taking medication, my suggestion to you is, find a doctor you really trust. Find one that REALLY listens to you. Do your research. Stop the medication immediately and call your doctor if you are having ANY of the side effects listed on the medication information paperwork and try something new. If you are living with family, let them know what to watch out for too. They will sometimes notice things that you don't. I tried 12 different conventional depression medications before I tried a mood stabilizer that really worked. Find a good counselor. If you can, find a physiologist that will communicate with your psychiatrist. Don't give up and remember that you are strong. You realize that something is wrong and you are getting the help you need to get better. ",

I've found Zoloft the best - raises my base mood, and the side effects (dry mouth and a little more trouble reaching orgasm) aren't too bad.\n\n2) Exercise you enjoy and can do every day - I enjoy weightlifting and boxing training, so I do those.  I can't lift every day but boxing training of some kind can be done daily, even if it's just rope skipping and shadow-boxing.  Both raise my energy level and social confidence, which help with depression and anxiety.\n\n3) Low-carb / low-sugar diet - with the exception of two Coke Zeros and one daily shot of Maker's Mark (both used as rewards) and the occasional cheat meal, I eat a pretty strict, calorie-restricted keto diet with a ton of veggies.  Keto isn't as important as just avoiding sugar / carb addiction, though.  Those are the real mood- and energy-killers.\n\n4) Mindfulness meditation - I have long struggled with obsessive thoughts, especially about failed relationships, which has contributed to my depression and loneliness.  Mindfulness meditation helps a lot with this, as it teaches you to let thoughts come and go and recognize they are not you and need not occupy your mind.  You can do it in 15 minutes a day, anytime, anywhere.\n\n5) Cognitive-behavioral therapy - go to a therapist for about 6-12 weeks, read A Guide To Rational Living or The Depression Workbook and learn and practice the techniques.  They're simple, elegant, and they work.\n\n6) Sleep - let yourself get as much as you need every night.  No excuses - you'll accomplish more in 16-18 hours well-rested than in 20 hours sleep-deprived.   Avoid caffeine after the late afternoon. Turn off all electronics an hour before bedtime.  Take a sleep aid if you need to.  Masturbate.\n\n7) Socialize positively - force yourself to do so daily, and choose positive, high-energy friends (avoid fellow depressives - emotions are contagious).  If you don't already have friend groups, join some groups that meet regularly because friendships are nearly impossible to make if you're not seeing the people regularly.\n\n8) Keep it clean and tidy - sometimes when you're really depressed, the first thing you need to do is just get up and make the bed, then shit shower shave and put on clean clothes.  It's amazing how much that can change your mood and your day.  Once you're up, clean your room and house, too.  Having a clean and tidy environment will help you feel you're handling life okay.\n\nCombine all of these together and they do wonders.  If you're just starting out recovering, start with sleep and being clean and tidy, then go get meds and therapy, then start exercising and meditating, then change your diet, then get out and socialize.

I'd love to share my thoughts, a few things:\n\nThe major key for me has been choosing to know what is good for me vs feeling what was good for me. What I mean is whenever I'm in a very low mood or going through a bout of high anxiety I learned that I couldn't trust my own brain. My thoughts would be\n\n\"I'm too tired\"\n\n\"I can't be bothered\"\n\n\"What if this happens?\"\n\n\"I'm useless\"\n\n\"I don't know if I want this anymore\"\n\n\nWhether it was my job, hobbies, activities or my long distance relationship with my girlfriend (now fiance) my day to day stress (high) coupled with my mental illness cultivated what I've heard being called a \"fear brain\". My mind would think of 100 reasons not to do or continue something for no good reason other than the perpetuating cycle of anxiety, fear, doubt, depression swirling in my head. What I learned to do was address and pursue the positive things in my life that I *knew* were good for me even if I didn't *feel* like they were:\n\n- Even if my my job is stressful at times, it brings me an income and it's full of good people who genuinely care about me.\n- Even if I have doubts at times about my relationship, whenever I'm with my girlfriend I feel like a better, more complete person and I love her for who she is. I know there's no red flags and that she makes an amazing partner.\n- My exercise and training is hard but it helps me immensely and keeps me in a community.\n\nChoosing to pursue these things regardless of how I *felt* about them at times was a major breakthrough for me. I finally got engaged to my girlfriend after 4 years of long distance dating and being a mess of doubt and indecision. I've started training more frequently (MMA) and I've made an effort to continue my work in a positive way. And I am a better man for it all. \n\nI can't stress enough just how much at times I wanted to quit on all 3 of those things. But again, for no reason other than fear all because of my anxiety and depression. I am so glad that I decided to push myself to take steps forward in life. If you don't take a step then you'll just stay where you are and watch your life pass you by, all for nothing. \n\nI still suffer from mental illness today, but I've managed to get by with a mix of taking care of myself, talking to my Doctor about medication and CBT, and speaking to a counselor. The symptoms are different for everyone and every person will have a challenge unique to themselves but I believe a key is to be active in seeking help, find things you know you love and pursue them. \n\n",

If your depression is so severe that these tactics don't work, the depression seems to not be as circumstantial, and you've had the problem for years, then this might be applicable. \n\nMedicine really can do wonders for you when just making life changes doesn't cut it or you don't have the strength to enforce them. The thing you need to remember is DO NOT ACCEPT PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS FROM A GENERAL PRACTITIONER. They are unqualified to diagnose and prescribe what can be very dangerous drugs. I've volunteered and worked in mental health and I've seen this as a huge problem and the pathway on medicinal recovery with drugs that mess with your serotonin (which is common medicine for depression) can be pretty dangerous. Only accept a referral to see a PSYCHIATRIST and then look them up. There are a lot of good and bad doctors out there. \n\nNext, the path to find the right drug(s) can be short if you're lucky, but it's more common for it to take a few tries. It took me 4 years to find the right combo and that's not bad. Just don't give up if you know medicine is the right path for you. It takes patience and you may have to make a decision between feeling better with side effects or not feeling better, but it's best to try new things and get a better combination. \n\nIf you have to take drugs and they start to help, THEN the work begins. Your goal for medicinal treatment is mental clarity. Not happiness or whatever. Anti-depressants are supposed to make you not depressed. If you feel overly happy, there may be a problem. Once you have mental clarity, all these life changing pieces of advice come into play and they can actually work! The thing is, I was thinking what I would tell my younger self if I had the chance in how to deal with this and I wouldn't say to get drugs right away. If you can hold out till 25 to take drugs, it's your best bet as the brain doesn't stop developing til then. But to tell myself to do all the things I'm doing now, it would be useless because without mental clarity, it's like asking a chimp to do your taxes. It's just dumb. \n\nThe best advice I can give and the best advice for anyone in the world is SPEAK. Talk to someone. Anyone. And be careful with therapists and scout around for a good one. Talking about your problems can do so much good, you wouldn't believe. I thought I was super strong for holding my problems in but it just made me weaker. Turns out it's a hell of a lot harder to speak out rather than holding it in. This piece of advice is imperative.\n\nDepression is a normal part of life. I didn't realize that til I was better and I found out that people just go through hard times. Who knew? But sometimes it's clinical and making decisions is nearly impossible. If that's the case, just remember you're sick. Don't accept it as a part of who you are, don't see it as romantic, and don't think of it as a virtue and steer clear of people who do. Mental illness makes you crazy and you don't want to be that. I've heard so many people with bipolar who say they wouldn't change a thing because of this dumb reason or that. I feel as though recovery has made me learn how to make better decisions but I'm no fool...I would have loved to live without this crap.\n\nHope this helps.",

Depression means that your neurochemistry is screwed, there is a physical reason for what you are experiencing, you are not a weakling. If your bone is broken you wont be able to use that limb until you fixed it. If your emotions/brain dont work properly due to a depresssion it just wont work fine. That being said: Dont let your false emotions get the better of you. I thought of comitting suicide every 20 minutes f\u00fcr nearly a year but I knew it was just my brain trying tricks. Don't ever give in, it will be better. Going back to the analogy: when your leg is broken you wont be able to run. That does not mean you will never ever run again, just not until there was some healing!\n\nmost important: get professional help. There is no need to endure it. If you have a disease or injury you take care by taking medicine or resting, same goes for the brain. Here help could be medcine but also therapy, it really helps a lot although it might take a while.\nNo one here can help you as a professionel can. All tipps below are very generic. Do not listen to self-proclaimed therapists with no professionel education! \n\nDo some cardio workout 2-3 a week (running, rowing, cycling, swimming), it releases signal molecules which scientifically proven are sufficient to help against 80% of depressive symptoms! Dont you dare overthink that: do not think what other's in the gym might think. You need to do this for yourself.\n\nI always had to tell me: I dont want to be that fucking sad anymore! I want to get better! I have been better before and I can get better again!\n\nFriends can support you but many dont understand. They cannot! They still love you but they cannot understand. Dont expect them to. Those you really really want to keep need information though; tell them that you have a rough time and want to get things better and that you want to keep them as friends!\n\nI know how difficult it is. How difficult even to get out of bed, brush your teeth, shower, get dressed. Calling a friend seems impossible. What to even talk about. I know that feeling. \n\nJust to give you glimmer of hope: \nI have been on medicine for a year and in therapy for two and I've been close to end myself. Today I have a wife, a son and finishing my PhD.\nI could not see this back then. There was no future in my mind, just pain and loneliness. It got better with help! ",

If you feel good, you'll feel great, if you feed bad, you'll feel terrible. Once you have experience with it and a strong positive association with it that largely stops happening, but you have to make sure you can level yourself without pot or you won't be able to function unless you're high, and that's bad).

I don't think it really ever does \"go away\", but it does \"get better\".  \n\nNot sure if my own experience will help a single person, but I'd still like to share in the event that it does happen to give the slightest glimmer of hope to someone.  \n\n^((Throwaway because I would like to retain some amount of privacy.))  \n&nbsp;\n\nThroughout my years of childhood, I'd say about 7 years old, up until about 17 (?), I was bullied fairly consistently. The worst was during elementary and middle school. The reality of it is, is that everyone is bullied to some degree. For me, it felt like everyday was absolute torture, I'd undoubtly dread going to school; I remember vividly one morning of 4th grade I cried and cried sitting at the front of the school in my mothers car about feeling absolutely sick, that I couldn't stand up, all of which was a lie, but I was just so bothered and scared to enter that building, worried about my daily torture which would immediately resume. Amongst these events, at age 11 I was formally diagnosed with ADHD ^((more so hyperactive back then, while transitioning into more of a hyperfocus in my early twenties)) as well as being thrown into a few other situations in my early life that induced extreme stress, paranoia, distrust, trauma, and of course, depression. I essentially thought that because of this all, life would keep getting worse and worse, harder and harder, until death.  \n&nbsp;\n\nI was 16 years old when I was \"officially\" diagnosed with any type of depressive disorder. The professional I seen that afternoon came to the conclusion and diagnosis of Major depressive disorder (MDD), better known as just 'depression'. It was a bit of a shock to me, since growing up the way depression was seen, and how I understood it in my mind at the time, was that I was now, all of a sudden, horribly diseased, with the confirmation that the type of thoughts that say \"well who's going to want to be your friend or want you around now?\" would be reality on top of my already existing lack of luck within social interaction. In actuality, none of it was really a surprise, just more so finally setting in that \"HEY, PAL, YOU'VE GOT AN ISSUE AND NOW IT'S APPARENT\". Beforehand my father always kept an eye on me, but it really started to all fall into place and \"make sense\" after speaking with a handful of specialists. My immediate family (father, sister) from that point forward tried numerous things to help me grow, address and more so cope with depression. They never stopped trying, and still to this day help out as much as they can.  \n&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately, for most, if not all people, depression is a sort of beast that can only really be \"tamed\" by your own person. What I mean by this, at least for me, is that to this day, I have never really felt that any outside aid has set \"the law\" for my depression ^((which is how I believed that it would work at first)); more so that the outside aid HELPED guide me into the point of being able to make the laws for my depression to adhere to. A person can have specalists, family and friends offer them a variety of plans of action to \"overcome\" depression, yet still feel as if none of it truly works. That's the issue, it feels like the pain, lack of pain, or absolute emptiness will never TRULY end, or even that they don't give a shit if it ends, because hell, \"I've been here for this long, why would I care if it ever does stop, get worse, etc\". What I found for myself was that after years of trying different medications ^((both properly used and improperly used)), talking to therapists, exercising, using mental and physical stimualtion, the thing that finally broke the \"cycle\" of my depression was, as /u/ARealHuman has said already, \"forcing\" myself out of it. Waking up one day, still sick as ever, being in my bed for roughly six months, over and under sleeping, not showering for weeks on end, just existing and thankfully finally having absolutely and utterly enough of just \"existing\".  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;*\"But hold on- ..wait?* ***What?*** *I just read your sob story above to hear the same shit everyone has said over and over, that it won't get better unless* ***I DO SOMETHING?! BUT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING!!\"***\n \n&nbsp;\n\n>Scream.  \n\n>Relax.  \n\n>Hold on - take a second.  \n\n>Now breathe.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nReady? Okay. Walk with me, and I'll try to explain what I mean.  \n&nbsp;\n\nThink of an anti-depressant as a tranquilizer - it's purpose is to numb the \"pain\", whatever that \"pain\" may be for you. It's not supposed to cure you, stop the issue completely or change you overall - it's immediate and only purpose, is to help you get from the point of no return, back into the mentality of \"okay\", so that you can have a somewhat-stable (stable being used very loosely) slate to start from. From there, it's ultimately up to you, the person, to get from \"okay\" to \"I can do this, whether it's in a few months or in a few years, I'll eventually get over this shit\". \nThat process of thought is what gets you from not being able to leave your bed, to walking back into reality.  \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;*\"But reality sucks, life sucks, this shitstorm doesn't end and even if I feel 'okay' with help of medication, or whatever else, life isn't going to get better!\"*  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nI hear you, but take this into consideration for a moment - Why? *\"Why?\"* Yes, why? *\"What do you mean?\"* Why does reality, and life itself, suck? *\"Well, I could give you numerous reasons!!\"* Okay, let's tackle them one by one.\n\nIf there's an issue in your life that you cannot see past whether it be that reality is absolutely pointless at the end of it all or there is no happiness, just ask yourself why you see it that way. Start trying to logically explain what the cause is, and try to see if MAYBE there's a solution to it. Try to dial back the emotion (or lack there of) and explain with simple logic, what is the reason this is what I feel and how could I maybe, possibly, change it?  \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;*\"Okay, I see your point, but man I just have absolutely zero energy, I can't get the hell out of bed, how could I start to do any of this?!\"*  \n&nbsp;\n\n\nGood retort - here's what you may want to try.\n\nTake this shit day by day. Literally. Day one, try to get out of bed, look out your window, maybe watch youtube, eat some bread, then back to bed with your sleepy feeling self. Day two, repeat the process, but add something else, whether it be brushing your hair out, or moving whatever that object is that has been sitting weird for months yet you've never had the energy to really do something about it. Keep switching it up, but take it slow, because this whole overwhelming, never-ending hell does not change overnight. It never will, it can't, and that's how it is.  \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;*\"That's* ***bullshit****!\"*  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Completely**, I know - it absolutely, no questions asked, **sucks**.\nBut y'know what helps? Knowing that eventually, it will change, as long as you try, even with the smallest amount of effort. \n\nI swear to you ^((yeah, stranger over the internet promising you something, AS IF, right?)), that one of these days you're going to step outside, you're going to be playing whatever game it is that was fun a year ago but now isn't as inviting as once before, you'll be seeing your best mate and even maybe spending some time with a person that would never want to see you hurting in that type of hell ever, ever again. I went from a happy, care-free six year old, to a miserable, depressed preteen, to an even worse just \"existing in what felt like purgatory and eventually not-caring-whatsoever-teenager\", to finally a twenty-something year old person that still struggles day to day with getting out of bed, still struggles with overwhelming emotion as well as absolute emptiness, yet still surviving, still here, still breathing and most days feeling like \"okay, this sucks, but it's better, and it'll keep getting better as long as I try\". There's no quick fix, there's no angel or solace that will eventually appear from nothing and tell you it will all be okay. It won't. There will be pain, there will be struggle, however, with all of that, there will come *change*, there will come *positivty* and there will come achievement.  \n&nbsp;\n\n#&nbsp;&nbsp;TL;DR  \nYears ago, I honestly would've told myself that I'm full of shit, it'll never get better, I CAN'T possibly feel okay after all of this, but today, I'm writing this out, because I want any of you to know that seriously enough, the littlest amount of effort will in all actuality, help bring you out of your own, personalized version of hell. **You need to force yourself to try.** It sucks, it's hard, however it's the worst-yet-best truth I'd ever had to expereince personally, and give out in advice. Asking for help, DOES NOT make you weak. Taking medication, DOES NOT make you weak - seeking out a method of aid DOES NOT and WILL NEVER make you weak. Millions of people have sought out help, including myself, and without doing so, most likely would not of made it to where we are today if we never took that first step.  Do not be ashamed, even if it feels like you're a worthless, disgusting indiviual because of the issues you face, because truthfully you're not worthless, nor disgusting, it's just our old frenemy \"Depression\" upstairs likes to talk shit a whole bunch, *too* much.  \n&nbsp;\n\nIf anyone wants to talk please always know that there is someone, somewhere. [This index](http://togetherweare-strong.tumblr.com/helpline) (click to go) lists available help, as well as links to communities built on giving help to those in need.\nEven if you'd like to send me off a message, please by all means feel free, as just an ear to listen or as someone to talk to - I'll be checking back frequently.  \n&nbsp;\n\nAbove all, I hope you find the ability to get out of bed, whether that's today or next year, and feel \"okay\". \u2665",

If you put food in front of me, though, I'd manage a few bites.) If I said no, he'd say okay let's go, we're going to get something to eat, and we'd go. We didn't talk much and he never made me talk or anything, but it helped so much to have someone nearby.   \n\nEventually, something in me just turned a corner, but I'll never forget his kindness during that time.  \n\nThe second one was very different, and far scarier. I legitimately wasn't sure I would make it through alive. I remember the fear - the cold, distant fear, but the not knowing what I would do if I was alone... it was very, very different. I can't even explain it now, not really. I would ask friends to come over and just sit with me. Watch TV with me. It didn't matter, please just don't leave me alone with my demons. (I'm actually getting emotional writing this, thinking about it.) After a month or so, I managed to get enough of myself together and made a phone call for a referral to a psychiatrist, who prescribed me antidepressants and antianxiety medication, which helped greatly - it turned off that part of my brain. And eventually I managed to get off those.    \n\nBut the hardest part - which I'm sure most people who suffer from depression will tell you - is actually getting enough energy/desire/*something* together to take an action, any action at all.  \n\nIf you're suffering -- good luck.

They referred me to a psychologist, who in turn referred me to a psychiatrist for meds. I now go to the psychologist around every three weeks, and every six to the psychiatrist for an update on meds.\n\nIf you don't want to follow this path, here are my recommendations:\n1. Distract yourself. I know it is difficult, but this is an important first step. Distract yourself.\n2. Meditate. I recommend the headspace app, but any guided mindfulness video on YouTube will do. I recommend you do this at least once a day, no matter how difficult it may seem in the beginning. Keep going and make this part of your daily routine.\n3. Talk, find someone who has experienced the shit you're going through right now as well, and talk to them. Make sure it is someone you trust.\n4. Set small goals. Things like making breakfast, tying your shoes. Something on this scale. I am a gamer, so I pretend that they are mighty quests. Find something that works for you.\n5. Make a good things diary, and write down three good things that you did, every day, and three good things that happened to you, every day.\n\nI wish a lot of luck, with my whole heart, and I think that you can do this.

I wasn't feeling okay - pain everywhere in my body for no apparent reason, dysregulated breathing all the time, painful headaches, tachycardia, fatigue and the list goes on. I felt if I didn't change soon, my body would develop some sort of disease and things would be more complicated for me and my family. Thus, I changed using my willpower. It worked for me.\n\nIt wasn't easy though. As everyone did at least once, I said to myself 'I'll change' but it turned out to be only words and not meaningful actions. I'm lucky to have a family who embraced me and tried with all their strenght to get me out of this situation, but only I was able to change.\n\nTake notice that seeking professional help and/or meds to help you go through depression should not be ignored, it all depends on you. Actually, anything that help you should be taken into consideration.\n\nIf you, at this moment, can't get out of depression, at least think that you're doing everything you can to surpass it.\n\nJust a message in thousands.

Sounds like hippie nonsense but puts you in touch with pure conscious experience. Ever been so absorbed in something that you just existed while doing it? Meditation cultivates that. It's magical. Only problem is it takes a lot of practice but you can start feeling effects after a week or two of good practice. It's also great at stopping depression further down the line. \n\n2. Exercise. Weightlifting and running for me. Start small, and just get out there and do it. Get a routine going. \n\n3. St John's wort. Get it in medicated form as Remotiv, better than herbal supplement from vitamin shops. It's a very effective mood regulator and just generally stops you from being too neurotic, with very few side effects. \n\n4. Routine. Get a list of things to do every day. ",

I recommend just going to some yoga classes until you find something that resonates with you, same with theraphy if your therapist doesn't make you feel better maybe it's not the connection you need right now. Don't believe that everything you might think is wrong just because you are depressed, trust your gut. \nIf you're short on cash find alikamenova's yoga channel on youtube and listen to positive affirmations by Louise Hay, you will cry and maybe identify where your problems are and how to heal those wounds. \nEverything is cyclical, after periods of contraction come periods of expansion, all is well :) ",

Sometimes, I still let it get the best of me for a while, but I have a supportive spouse who will point out things I need to hear (we try to look for physical signs that a bout is coming on). I have found art therapy to be an outlet. The drawings I do while I am depressed at sooo much more skillful than the ones when I am not depressed. It is weird but it kind of makes me embrace the suck a little bit. Just enough to ride through it. I am not suggesting every one can ride through it, but, I have worked with several therapists over the years. My depression is, I think, related to trauma/OCD... But it is hard to say what came first. Anyway, for me... Routines help a lot, but I have accepted that depression will ultimately catch up to me occasionally... But I work to not let it get the best of me for too long. I would say I have probably been barely functioning around 3-4 times, and at least moderately depressed but surviving enough 3-4 times...

As a lot of others already said, exercise also helped vent that negative energy. Surrounding myself with friends and family helped immensely, and most of them didn't even know at the time. I'd really emphasize staying busy though; either in your school, job, faith, projects, whatever helps to keep your mind and thoughts from settling too much. I still struggle with depression, but it's gotten a lot better. Life will always get better, just look for the things that bring you joy.

Some people's depression is too heavy to reliably keep up those activities - the immediate answer to this problem I hear is discipline and motivation.\n\nYes exactly, but where do you think that comes from? Part of what antidepressants can do is take away that layer of uncontrollable emotion, tiredness and bleakness, and give you an open road to getting your discipline back.\n\nPsychological help such as CBT is excellent at retraining you to filter the unhealthy thought processes from the healthy, and reduce the depression until it (hopefully) no longer returns.\n\nBut without antidepressants, sometimes CBT is far too heavy a task for patients to do effectively, and it's much easier once the patient has found an antidepressant that works for them.\n\nThink of antidepressants as an umbrella on a cold, rainy day, and CBT a warm winter jumper. CBT teaches you how to stay warm, but it's far less effective if your world is still constantly raining because the rain will soak through it. Adding an SSRI is like blocking the rain with an umbrella while the CBT works at keeping out the cold - until the rain dies down and you no longer need the SSRI.\n\nLikewise, the strength to keep myself exercising and socialising came to me in droves once I found an SSRI that worked for me. \n\nNot everyone is the same and everyone has massively different levels of depression, but if you find yourself at far too deep a level to keep up the above activities, they may be worth a shot.\n\nEdit: a few words.",

Try and find someone you enjoy seeing, who delivers therapy that makes you feel like you're getting somewhere, even if that's one tiny step at a time.

It took me 5 years of switching on/off various antidepressants before I found an anti-anxiety medication that has helped me like nothing before. Patience pays off!\n\nAlso, if the antidepressants don't work for you like they didn't for me: I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND GOT THERAPY. DON'T BE AFRAID TO GO TO THE DOCTOR/LICENSED THERAPIST AND GET THERAPY. CBT has changed my life, it absolutely 100% works and there are hundreds of peer-reviewed articles out there if you need convincing like I did.\n\nYou can absolutely make it out as a happy, healthy, thriving individual but please be patient and kind with yourself during the process. It's SO worth it. I highly encourage anyone who is struggling to reach out to a doctor. Like, yesterday.",

It was horrible, for a week I had migraines and I couldn't stop vomiting but the actual medication was making my anxiety worse than it had been before and I couldn't put up with it anymore. Second time quite the same. It makes you feel like there's either no hope for you or meds are a scam. \n\nNow that I'm on the right one I can actual feel like I'm more normal.

I drank a lot of energy drinks, still kinda do but only sugar free and no more than one a day. I remember coming home and punching walls because of a shitty customers and realized this had to stop.\n5. A phrase that suck with me was, \"The mind follows the body and the body follows the mind\".

Despite starting to meditate earlier in life, I felt that once I hit that new low I couldnt let the horrible thoughts flow, I couldn't not be bothered by them, be alone with them, so I stopped meditating. His videos changed that and even now when I feel too tired or stressed I let his video on, lie down and take slow breathes.

Some people respond better to other neurotransmitters being hit, like norepinephrine/dopamine/histamine/cholinergic receptors.\n\nThen there are other drugs that act in a completely different way in the brain but are very effective at alleviating depression - ie. ketamine.\n\n>Often times you feel worse when you take them, but thats just the imbalance working itself out.\n\nThat's nonsense.

There are some people who you will click with like a best friend and find love with which is awesome and good for your mental health I believe.  \n  \nSometimes you end up with someone who cares about you and who you care about, but you guys aren't always on the same wavelength. For example, a buddy of mine is a homebody and loves to just chill and watch movies while his girlfriend like to go out to clubs and dance on weekends. He enjoyed shows like game of thrones and she wanted to watch the Kardashians but when you spoke to them about their opinions on something like Kale they would have the same response.  \n  \nSo, they were similar and cared for one another but the last straw for them was going on vacation together and realizing they didn't want to do anything the other person did. When you first start out in a relationship you're open to anything the other person wants to do but a few years in you begin to stop if you were just faking it in the first place for the joy of the other cause it becomes tasking. I think that happened to my pal and I would think that kind of relationship would do bad things to your mental state because you might attribute some of the things that are wrong on to yourself instead of realizing maybe it just wasn't the right match. On the other hand, if you are depressed and the person you spend the most time with derives happiness from you as you do from them then it's almost impossible not to be happy and grateful when you are with them but that doesn't mean you are immune from the feeling, it just helps keep it at bay.

Much of the stuff you'll read here in this thread.  I made lots of life changes (going from being poor to making quite a good salary in a respectable career, getting out of a bad marriage, etc.)  Exercise/diet (I lost over 100 lbs at one point) did nothing for my depression.  SSRIs helped, but they came with their own set of drawbacks and basically flatlined me emotionally.  I was off and on a few different kinds for ~15 years.  Therapists helped me deal with the depression; they didn't make it go away, they just helped me deal with it.  It was like having a broken leg and being taught how to limp to get where you're going instead of fixing the leg.   Eventually I went med-free and used the advice from a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist (whom I really liked) to basically limp through life as best I could.  At this point I was resigned to it being a way of life.\n\nI didn't try magic mushrooms (or any psychedelic for that matter) until I was in my 40s, after reading about more and more people using them to \"fix\" their depression and anxiety (which I now also had, thanks to the aforementioned bad marriage).  I'd been depressed for most of my life and had experienced bad anxiety for a few years.  \n\nI took one 3.5 gram dose of mushrooms, under carefully-considered conditions which were hopefully conducive to the results I wanted.  Had an amazing 11+ hour experience, and the next day both my depression and anxiety were completely gone.  Completely.  It has been several months since then, and I've had exactly three nights where I felt depressed.  One dose was all it took to tear apart my mind and put it back together in a healthier way.\n\nI've since taken way smaller doses 3 or 4 times, just experimenting with the effects to see what they do to me personally.  I've learned that I'm a lightweight with them, but that's perfectly OK by me.  But I haven't taken them again for therapy.  I still feel fine.  Depression and anxiety are both gone 99% of the time, and when they do knock on the door for an hour it's very manageable now thanks to what I learned from my old Cognitive Behavioral Therapist.\n\nI could evangelize all day about how great mushrooms are, but I'll shut up for now.  Hopefully you got something out of reading it.",

The problem I found is that it focuses on managing symptoms instead of working to eradicate the root cause (if that's even possible), what I eventually found was a more psychoanalytic-based approach which I think works with 'object relations theory'. \n\nBasically it works for me because it gives me explanations for my bothersome thought processes (mainly focused on childhood experiences, coping mechanisms formed to deal with those, relationship with caregivers etc) and is very very non-pathologised - I was more or less diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder and constantly taking tests and talking about my anxiety etc. with previous therapists. With this one, I don't think I've even uttered the word 'depression' more than a handful of times. The problems are still the same but treating them differently has helped so much. YMMV though, CBT works great for some people, psychoanalysis is useless nonsense for some, I've also been told by someone that it was too heavy for them (since you have to dredge up a lot of traumatic things to do it in the first place).

I'm always about the scientific evidence behind things but I have to say, although it's there, what convinced me to go ahead with it was the process of elimination. I'm in my early 20s and headed for medical school and knew that if I didn't change, I wouldn't have a future, and if years of bouncing around with medications didn't help, then what did I have left to do? Therapy. I hadn't tried it and I had heard mountains of anecdotal evidence in support of it so what the hell did I have to lose? I think this sentiment could prove useful for you, as you mentioned not necessarily believing in therapy but your current meds only helping so much.\n\nI'm sure that you've also heard anecdotal evidence yourself but I'd like to add one more piece to that, from my own experience: for 5 years I was treated with meds for \"depression\". A year later after no progress with the meds I decided on CBT. Within 2 weeks we uncovered that I actually have PTSD from stuff in my childhood that I wouldn't ever have thought to connect to my present state. I started being treated for that with a CBT program developed for veterans and I wouldn't have ever changed if I had kept on meds, because I wouldn't have been appropriately treated and I would've kept going through life suffocating in my despair. \n\nIt was the best decision I've ever made in my entire life. The second best decision I made was finding another therapist after the first one didn't work out, and then another one after that. You'll have some \"start up costs\" at first (courage, PATIENCE, persistence, and openness-you gotta lay ALL of your cards on the table and tell your therapist EVERY SINGLE THING; you never know what will link together), but it will absolutely be so worth it.\n\n[Brain connectivity changes occurring following cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis predict long-term recovery](http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v7/n1/full/tp2016263a.html)\n\nFrom Johns Hopkins; link to paper toward the bottom: [Talk therapy -- not medication -- best for social anxiety disorder, large study finds](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140925205629.htm)\n\nI can't find the actual study but here's an article: [CBT for treatment resistant depression](https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/journal/1-s2.0-S0140673612618443) \n\n[Evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy/motivational enhancement therapy (CBT/MET) in a treatment trial of comorbid MDD/AUD adolescents](https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S0306460311001122?returnurl=null&referrer=null)\n\n[Shame and Guilt in Social Anxiety Disorder: Effects of Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Association with Social Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061713#s3)\n\nAbove are a few to get you started and I encourage you to do some digging of your own as well.

And even then, she always has earbuds in, and she takes her food to her room to eat.\n\nSometimes I'm not even sure whether or not she's home. She has a car, but doesn't always use it when she goes out. So sometimes I see her car in the driveway and just assume she's in her room. Then I'll hear her get home from school an hour later.

Most of the things in this thread count as such. Even when suffering depression, there's occasionally gaps in the clouds. \n\nBut if it _is_ a brain chemistry thing, then you never completely fix it - you just might push yourself up enough to 'get by'. Medication to adjust that broken brain chemistry is the answer in that scenario.\n\nI think the reason anti-Ds get a bad rep is that they... well, they screw with your brain. They can quite easily change who you are, because ... well, that's sort of what you're hoping they'll do. That's why people dislike them or fear them. Or then there's the transition from the empty void of depression, to letting some actual misery catch up with you. That's no fun at all. It really isn't all that uncommon from people to transition from 'Void' to 'extremely emotionally distressed' - because a lot of stuff has been buried and festering for a long time. If you only see _that_ bit, it looks like anti-Ds have done more harm than good. \n\nBut really - it shouldn't be viewed any different to cancer. Something that sometimes needs some quite serious action to 'knock back' because the alternative is a slow road to death.\n\nChemo is pretty horrific if you think about it, and some people choose not to do it as a result. But that doesn't mean we do (or should) judge the people who decide either way. \n\nAnd depression is very definitely a fatal illness - it may look like the final act is a decision, but it's not - not in the 'informed consent' sort of way you might think, because that same brain chemistry imbalance is really screwing up your ability to make good decisions.  And on the way there, it'll do a lot of damage to you and everyone around you too. \n\n",

Also, not all depression is the same, not by a long shot.\n\nFor instance, diabetes is a disease.  My dad has type 2 diabetes.  He was prescribed Metformin to keep his blood sugar levels in check.  Dad doesn't like relying on doctors and medication, so he changed his lifestyle.  He started working out and eating right, which helped him drop 50 lbs.  That took him from obese to athletic range, and that helped his blood sugar tremendously.  He doesn't eat candy or drink soda or consume any overly sugary things anymore.  That helps his blood sugar levels.  So he still has the disease, but because he took matters into his own hands, the dosage he takes is 1/4 what it was before.  \n\nPrescriptions are great, but they are NOT the ONLY way to treat an imbalance a disease causes.

When she finally started knocking a ball around like a 60lb cat, I started packing my stuff and got out of a situation that was making my symptoms worse. We bonded so tightly that it was like an extension of me. It kept me alive. The slope was not a continuous upward climb, but it was gradually got to a place where I could function again. When she died (sudden heart failure) I emotionally crashed. I had to relearn how to cope without her. I miss her, but she taught me so much.

                    "body": "I'm reposting this because it's fucking golden... [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3wxj1k/what_is_the_best_thing_about_being_unattractive/cxzpng4/?st=iyfwy7g0&sh=be138e2c).\n\nAs a fairly unattractive young woman, I can say that it's kind of great. Why? Simple. It's the way men react towards me.\n\nI've talked about this at length with my girlfriends, who keep me around to boost their own self-esteem, sort of a living reminder that no matter how ugly they think they look, it could always be worse. We've found that a lot of men get kind of weird when they interact with attractive girls. All kinds of insecurities bubble to the surface. And by \"all kinds,\" I pretty much mean just penis size and penis ability. They think they won't measure up. They get wrapped up in this anxiety. They feel pressure to perform, which manifests itself first in \"scarety wang,\" then in premature ejaculation. Occasionally, they feel anger, which they sometimes direct towards the girl.\n\nThen there's me. I'm like a cool rain on a warm summer's eve. Not only am I not intimidating, I'm kind of soothing.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm not all bad in terms of attractiveness. I'm slender and have a pretty decent body, so long as I keep my body hair in check (I'm 3/7 Armenian). My hips are somewhat narrow, like a boy's, so childbirth will be painful, but I make up for it with a couple of perky breasts that are nearly the same size and a vagina that can perform peristalysis on account of all the kegels I've done over the years. That's where the good news ends.\n\nFrom the neck up, it's a real car crash. First off. My head is too large for my body. It makes shopping for hats extremely trying. Plus,it sits directly between my shoulders. I have no neck to speak of. I sort of look like a battletoad.\n\nMy face itself generally confuses anyone who gazes upon it. It's like a first year art student trying to channel Picasso by way of Bob Ross (\"let's put a nice little mole with some hair sticking out over here; it's a happy mole\"), but failing and badly. My sloped forehead is buttressed by a semenly perpetually furrowed brow more akin to a lowland gorilla than a human bean. It forms a little shelf for my dandruff to rest upon (I have dry scalp, a side effect of my having narrowly survived SIDS as a child). My eyes operate completely independent of one another. One stays close to my nose, which itself looks like a dong, while the other resides closer to my right ear almost like a fish. It's not pleasant to look at. In fact, most don't know where to look when conversing with me. But it does make it easier to check my blind spot when driving, so I've remained accident free and my auto insurance is reasonable despite my gender related handicap.\n\nTo make matters even worse, I also have a little mustache. Personally, I kind of like it. But it makes people angry, so I must deal with it. It is rather easy. I simply carry one of of those bleach pens wherever I go (works great on my butthole, too).\n\nThis whole package means that, when a guy meets me, it's a stress free affair. Rather than constantly trying to impress me, they can just be themselves instead of being a version of themselves they think is more desirable. It's more fun that way. Especially in the bedroom.\n\nYou see, having relations with me is like driving around in a beater -- scratching it up, slamming it thru a wall, and puking in it won't really affect its value. Honestly, I'm pretty much an old Buick, except I haven't merely been driven back and forth to church by an old lady, if you know what I mean (I mean I've been fucked more than a fan of any sports franchise from Cleveland).\n\nAnd most of them think it's only going to be the one time, anyway, because I'm nothing they'd want to be with long term. So I get their footloose and fancy free best. They don't worry about jizzing too quick, which leads them to pretty much never jizz too quick. No arguments when it comes to condom usage, either. Not a one of them would ever want to get me pregnant. They're too frightened by what might come out. Plus, I sort of look like I have leprosy. No one wants to catch that.\n\nEven better, I get guys when they're at their most experimental. You want to teabag me? Sure. Dip them in. Let them steep for awhile. Really extract all the flavor. And no way do they attempt the Springfield Spray Tan with little miss thing and her perfectly plucked eyebrows. She's ha\u00fate cuisine to these guys whereas I'm more like the Taco Bell test kitchen. Put me in a gordita, shoot me full of sour cream, wrap me in a burrito, deep fry my ass, then enjoy me when you're too drunk to care. I won't even charge you for extra guacamole.\n\nAny reservations they have about the size, shape, or colour of their hog go out the window, too. I am like Lady Liberty in that regard anyways. Give me your tired, your weak, even your Dutch. Your heaving erections, yearning to splooge freely. I'll take them all, and with a plum. What's that, you say? Can you put it in my asshole. Yes. Yes, you can. Don't worry about making a mess, either. I dropped the extra money on these rubber sheets for a reason and it's not because I'm a bed wetter. Did I mention I always carry a bleach pen?\n\nBeing attractive? It's for the birds. I'm happy just the way I am, thank you very much.\n",

Still though, more ignore this incentive than follow it. \n\nI've seen endless unattractive/obese people in the math department realize this incentive and instead of actually following it, just swap their inner identity without actually putting in any actual effort to stand out and become tedious insufferable assholes who see themselves as the awkward ugly math genius and, worse, refer to themselves as such out loud around the rest of the math majors who, because they actually care about the subject and advancing their knowledge, intuition, and proof writing, **far** out class these goons who make a habit out of vaguely alluding to non math students concepts that sound (but aren't) impressive and mysterious and inaccessible while actually failing Real Analysis by midterm for the second time. \n\nI'm informed by friends that this is common also in physics, CS, and philosophy as well. Calling them out in the wild while they are directly or indirectly belittling other fields/students is a thing a beauty. I remember one of the worst offenders once annoying some kid in calc 3 wrestling with line integrals for his homework while this asshole was, in a fairly well occupied room, going on about \"this stuff is trivial compared to what Im doing in *Analysis* with *infinity* and crazy *metric spaces*(where he was utter dead weight/worse than useless anytime I was grouped with him to work on in class proofs). I asked him, pretty sharply actually, to do the first and simplest line integral from the kids problem set and his shame was made way worse by the fact that he tried to put on a show at the white board for a bit before being like \"well Im used to doing more complex ones and I over thought it and got the wrong solution lol damn brain\" before getting the fuck out of there. In reality he didn't even know where to start and just wrote down a bunch of contextually appropriate notation and numbers. No one clapped or gave out $100s, but this did happen (shutting down condescension/belittling is pretty encouraged in my smallish and tight knit field where everyone feels imposter syndrome at some point or another and was general chill, social, and friendly ) and no, it did not change his behavior until he dropped out. I assume he still alludes to his days doing advanced math research to people on the bus.\n\nThese dudes aren't common enough to be called the rule, but far too common to be the exception.  \n\nSo, yeah, I just have an irritation with the concept of \"ugly, quiet, shy = smart\". \n\nIm going to ahead and spare myself the edits by mentioning now that no, public shaming isn't ok unless they are asking for it by doing it to someone else/deliberately being a nuisance.\n\nAlso r/nothingeverhappens",

It involved pulling random celebrities out of their asses to insult a more popular celebrity. And since the roasters are part of the audience, /r/roastme fails on yet another level, since even if one person *did* know the person they're roasting, what they say would not be well understood by anyone else, since they lack the context.\n\nThere should be a subreddit where people create fictional scenarios for roasts to happen. Maybe a traditional D&D party roasts each other, or Marvel/DC characters roast each other. Or the characters in a popular sitcom. At least then everyone in that thread would have a personal understanding about the roast and those being roasted. It'd be like /r/whowouldwin, only with less feats.",

Because viewers like that tend to tune in faithfully, night after night. This is no secret. \n\nMost of the other shows would play their emotions like a fiddle, and create false understandings and expectations about how the world worked. As a kid, it can even mess with your sense of time when you see an entire day \"happen\" in less than 30 minutes. \n\nUsually, some of these effects can be offset if the person gets out in the real world periodically and interacts with new or different people. But when you are wealthier, you tend to pull back from that. You increasingly worry about how others are out to take what you have. Being in a spread out city like the one I live in, with various gated communities, makes this effect worse. \n\nI know it sounds \"tinfoil hat-ish\", but the more I witnessed it, the more I came to view it as perhaps one of the bigger threats facing our nation. And this past election illustrates it almost perfectly. ",

I'd probably never really want a steady relationship with a girl who was a \"perfect 10\". She grew up being told by her parents to put some makeup on because she looked ugly and shouldn't be seen walking out of the house like that. obviously it fucked over her self confidence a lot. To me she's gorgeous, she can't see it obviously but just about everyone else can. Media is media. There's gonna be ridiculously attractive women but it's just skin deep. Not every guy or girl is gonna want someone who looks perfect. In my honest opinion what makes someone the most attractive to me is confidence and selflessness. Beauty is overrated, don't let it scare you into being alone. It's not the only quality a potential date looks for and it's not really a significant one. ",

Then I was fucking stoked.\n\nYou're right that the movie wasn't perfect, but it was the single best book to movie adaptation I've ever seen. The things they left out either didn't translate to film well or screwed with the flow of the movie. The casting was phenomenal. Not every character fit my imagination perfectly, but even if they didn't fit visually they played the characters perfectly. I cannot think of a more perfect Charlie than Logan Lerman. I just about screamed when I found out he was cast.\n\nThis movie didn't wreck me because I knew what I was getting into, but I watched it with my brother and a friend, and they were both pretty screwed up afterwards. They both thought it was a good movie but I highly doubt either will ever watch it again. I, on the other hand, own the DVD. My boyfriend couldn't even get halfway through the movie (but he's also not a movie person in general, and it was REALLY getting to him).",

Movie Charlie needed to be downplayed to remain tolerable. A lot of people already are like \"what the fuck did I just watch?!\" and having a more immature, disturbed main character...would not help the movie.\n\nThe book is still better, of course!",
