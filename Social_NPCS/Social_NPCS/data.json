But my go to starter gift for people who don't immediately regard my interest in being prepared with skepticism is this thing: http://www.ebay.com/itm/11-in-1-Multi-Tool-Card-Emergency-Survival-pocket-Knife-saw-bottle-opener-/160783665403 Its a buck. It will hide, safely in its included sheath, in your wallet or your purse with no problem. It is nonthreatening, it isn't TSA legal but hey, its a buck, so if they confiscate it who cares. But it'll serve you when you need a bottle opener, a sharp object, a screwdriver, a metric ruler, whatever. It's incredibly handy, and is my introduction to EDC.",

You only have a watermelon. Tell them that. They'll give you a funny look, a sigh of disappointment, then walk away. Robbers have no interest in watermelons. It's a proven fact. So you keep walking. The sounds of scuffling feet grab your attention. There's a basketball game going on. Not one second later you hear a POP! Someone killed the basketball. Everyone is sad. You casually walk into the situation, whip out your watermelon, then, with an air of cool confidence, say \"hey guys it's alright, I got it covered\". Watermelons make the perfect basketball replacement. It's a proven fact. You play a few games, not too aggresively, but not too amateur either. The vibe gets intense. Everyone's attention is on you and your mad watermelon skills. The women are giddy with joy, the men are blowing you kisses. With a quick nod and a warm smile, you resume your travels. You see a crackhead passed out on the sidewalk. \"ARE YOU OKAY?!\". No response. You spy a crack pipe nearby and place it into their mouth. You put your watermelon inside ever so softly, and light it up. The fumes release. The chemicals hit. He jolts awake. \"What have I done?!\". He runs off into the horizon. Later on you discover that he ran all the way to Brazil, where he cleaned up and started a successful business of breeding and selling parakeets. Watermelons have been known to help with crack addiction. It's a proven fact. You're getting tired. There's a coffee shop close by. You step in. You order a venti latte. \"$4.75\" she says. Bummer. You still have no money. You start to walk away. \"Wait a second... Is that... Is that...A watermelon?\". Her gaze is intense. Her interest is piqued. You present the truth. She goes nuts. \"Omigod omigod can I hold it, CAN I HOLD IT??\". You submit to her desire. She's thrilled, elated, even slightly aroused. Baristas LOVE watermelons. Proven fact. \"Omg that was so awesome, btw that venti you ordered, it's on the house\". Boom. You win. Outside again. Strolling briskly. You hear screams. You hear crying. You hear sirens. The mall is on fire. \"MY BABY IS INSIDE MY BABY IS INSIDE!!\". There's an older woman freaking out. Her baby is inside. \"What's going on?\" you ask a nearby policemen. \"Her baby is inside\" he says. He won't go save it because he's allergic to fire. \"I can't save it, I'm allergic to fire\" he tells you. \"Where are all the firemen?\" you handsomely inquire. \"It's their day off\". Duty calls. You run into the mall. It's on fire. You throw your watermelon at Sears. Watermelons are made of water, so the flames extinguish. You throw it at Hot Topic. You throw it at Ross. You throw it at every single store. Taco Bell is giving out free tacos, so you eat a few. Then you find a baby in the bathroom. Seems okay, so you put him in your pocket. The mall is totally dead and you get bored, so you leave. You remember that you have a baby in your pocket, and you also remember that lady saying her baby was inside. \"I think this is yours?\" you say as you hand the baby to her. She's pretty happy. The day is almost over. You feel a little lonely, so you talk some shit with your watermelon. It's a good friendship\u200b. It listens well. All in all, a fairly good day. Nothing went wrong, all thanks to your watermelon.",

When we got back to his SUV, the poor kid was pinned to the back seat, struggling to breathe. He was absolutely terrified, as was the father who had nothing to cut his son free. Unfortunately, neither did I. I didn't carry a knife at the time or anything else that might be considered practical. I did, however, have a box cutter in my car, so I sprinted back across the parking lot, grabbed it, returned, and cut the seat belt away. The kid was fine, pretty rattled, though not as badly as the dad who shook my hand, thanked me, got in his car and left. Things could have gone so much worse. We were lucky, but the reality was that I found myself in a situation where seconds mattered, and I had to waste them running back to my car to get something I should have been able to pull out of my pocket. That was the moment I started thinking seriously about the things I carry with me on a daily basis. Never again.",

Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.\u201d -Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy",

I quickly realized that number 1, most people pay with a credit card (which requires a signature when the food is delivered) and number 2 if you deliver to someones house and they have to go search for a pen your tip tends to be far less than if you had a pen for them to use. At offices it didn't matter since you usually meet them at the reception desk and they pretty much always have a cup filled with pens right there so no one has to search for a pen. It was my 3rd or 4th day I started carrying a pen in my pocket and that habbit has stuck with me to this day. It's very, very rare for me to not have one on me and it comes in handy far more than you'd expect. 10 out of 10. Would recommend this tip to everyone.",

I didn't know either of them and it turned out, she just gave a description, and one of his buddies thought it was me having seen me around. I was scared, because I've never been a fighter and most people just get jumped in Stockton (CA) but I watched a lot of TV and had a plan. Walking home from school, the guy and two of his friends stopped me. He was yelling at me about messing with his girl. I kept trying to tell him I had no idea who she was and that it wasn't me, but it was clear he wasn't hearing it. I put one hand in my pocket and took my stance saying, \"Alright, before we do this, I got one thing to say.\" He and his friends get ready, he leans in, eyes wide, and says \"What?\" I yell \"SHICKA SHA! POCKET SAND!!\" and throw a fist full of sand in their eyes, whip around, and run like a bitch. I hopped a big stone wall made it home and felt pretty great till I realized it would never work again and that I was going to be destroyed. The guy found me a few days later. He had actually found and dealt with the guy who messed with his girl. I asked if we were cool and apologized like crazy for the sand. He laughed and said that was some of the craziest shit he'd ever seen. Pocket sand can save you an ass whooping. Edit: Damn, thank you everyone. I'm glad folks enjoyed this story!

EDIT: Excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for those who don't get the reference. *\u201cVogon poetry is of course, the third worst in the universe. The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria. During a recitation by their poet master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem \"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning\" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been \"disappointed\" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his 12-book epic entitled \"My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles\" when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save humanity, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator, Paul Neil Milne Johnstone of Redbridge, in the destruction of the planet Earth. Vogon poetry is mild by comparison.\u201d* - Douglas Adams",

Dave crawled through the sand and opened the bag, there was a canteen full of whisky and pack of playing cards, Dave sighed and wondered if Death had just given him his \"winter lodge evening in\" bag instead of the \"forget everything in the desert bag because you finally beat Death's game\" bag. The canteen was emptied and Dave's now drunken state remained him of his grandfather. The man who both started and Indirectly ended his life. \"Well, it wasn't entirely his fault\" said Dave as he packed away the flask \"he was wrong about the games though, if it wasn't for that win I'd be turely gone and then he'd be sorry. But I'm still lost, there must be a road, or something near by.\" Dave fumbled as he closed the bag and dropped it on the floor, the cards fell out if their box and in this moment he remembered his grandfather's words. 'No matter how empty of a hole you're in you'll always have some bastard telling you how to play your cards.' He remembered them so clearly that he could smell the cigar smoke coming off his grandfather's lips. Dave was alone, and there is only one card game for the lonely. He'd never played solitarie before, it was one of the game he had never tried. so he just played the cards as he'd seen the people in the pubs do defore one of Ahnk-morpork's famous bar fights broke out. He reached for a card and moved it to a pile off to the left. \"Now, now you don't want to be doin' that.\" Two men had appeared from thin air. Maybe not the most helpful looking men, on account of the duck. \"Have you got change for a penny?\" Asked the more disgusting of the two. Dave did not. EDIT: Most of you look like you've enjoyed this short story so I've fixed some of the blatant errors (blatant because even I noticed them) and added a few bits.",

Late to the thread but what the hell...story time...My time to shine. This was nearly 20 years ago. When I was 11 years old...Back in the days of dial-up internet...Back when 15 second porn clips were 240p and got the job done. I used to save them to floppy drives. Anyway, I was 11, and my parents went to a wedding out of state for 10 hours. I figured it was the perfect time to start perfecting my masturbation techniques. I found this website (and I'll never forget the URL even 19 years later) nudecelebs.com. This was such a joke but man did I have the hots for Britney Spears. Anyway, I went on the website... Clicked yes a bunch of times and what I didn't realize was that the website dialed out overseas. I called my friend who lived across the street and told him hey, found this website with porn!! He was all excited and enjoyed the same fun that day. 2 weeks later I get a phone call. It was my friend. He was grounded. He said he got a bill in the mail for $400 for going on that website. My heart nearly sank into my balls. I went white. I had a panic attack. I nearly cried. I asked him how long he spent on it. He said 30-40 minutes. I was on it for like 4 hours. Exploring porn. Few days later, as I was sweating it out, I overheard my mother scream from downstairs. \"$2600 FOR WHAT?!?!\" I got the call to come downstairs. I went down, 11 years old, crying, ashamed, embarrassed, dead man walking. They took one look at me, said to go back upstairs. I never got yelled at. I was never punished. They knew I had learned my mistake and to never repeat it. Couple years later my father told me they never had to pay the bill. My mother threatened to sue them for making it so easy for an underage kid to be able to access that material. So they dropped the costs and stop asking for the money. It was squashed. Man, I haven't mentioned this story in over 10 years. And I'll never forget it.",

I would visit roleplay based rooms and I would pretend to be 16 years old and would use some very carefully angled photos where i felt it didn't show that I was actually 12 years old and pretty fat. I got into an online relationship with this guy from America who was 23, and although I never went on cam things got cybersexual and he used to tell me how he would take my virginity one day. It only lasted 4-6 months and He was actually pretty sweet, I felt bad that I was lying about my age but I was awkward looking, unpopular and at an all girls boarding school so I guess I just really liked the validation I got from the relationship. So one day he asks me what my address is because he's bought a present that he wants to send to me for my birthday (from Japan apparently). Immediately alarm bells start going off and I make up some excuse why I don't want to give my address although he was pretty pushy about it. After that things felt really weird and I stopped talking to him. I didn't speak to him for like 4 years after and one day I messaged him and asked him what the present had been as it had always bugged me. He said he had purchased a plane ticket to the UK to come see my in person for my birthday and that's why he wanted my address as he was going to surprise me. I told him then that I had lied really heavily about my age to which he replied \"you don't think I didn't realise you looked a lot younger in your photos? Obviously you weren't 16\" I just absolutely hate to think what would have happened if he did turn up and I waddled to the door in my spongebob pyjamas. That's probably up there in the most unnerving and scary experiences. That and the time a boy made a tumblr blog about me and messsged the guy I was fooling around with telling him that he \"shouldn't have deflowered me and that it should have been him to experience those sweet petals\" ",

There haven't been any problems and some have been my best friends for over a decade. There was one, however, that I still get freaked out when I think of. He said his name was Ryan, but I highly doubt that now. I had spent several weeks talking to him in our private chat room channel. He was really nice. Asked me about my day, what my likes were, what I wanted to do after college, etc. I really liked him because I had never had a real boyfriend and struggled with self-esteem. I was working at the local gas station part-time while I went through college. One day, a vase of two dozen roses got delivered with a note in it signed for me. My supervisor brought them to me and my jaw hit the floor. I had never told Ryan where I lived. A few hours later, the phone rang and my supervisor answered it. It was Ryan. She asked me if I wanted to talk to him. I was so scared, but I felt like it would be stupid to ignore someone who had found out where I worked. I said hello and someone that was definitely not the age he had told me (he had said he was 20, but this voice sounded like someone my dad's age) asked, \"Did you like the roses?\" I cordially said thanks, but that I couldn't stay on the phone since I needed to get back to work. He said it was okay and he'd talk to me later. I had a friend spend the night with me that night. I didn't tell my parents what was going on because they had always hated that I talked to people online. The next morning, I was scheduled to work at 8am. The gas station opened at 5:30am. I got a phone call from supervisor around 7am asking if I could come in early because no one had showed up to open the store. One of the regular early birds had called her to say the store wasn't open. I remember looking at my friend and thinking, \"Oh my god, Ryan *killed* them and is waiting for me to get there.\" Turns out, the opener had just overslept. \"Ryan\" had nothing to do with that, but I ceased all communication with him from that point on. Fortunately, that was the last I heard from him. I didn't join anymore new chat rooms after that. I stuck with the people I already knew. Could've turned out a whole lot worse and I know I'm lucky.

I found one video where the uploader would splice scenes of Jews being murdered along with shitty techno music and other violent scenes from different movies. I then called him out for being totally disrespectful. He replied to me with some standard name-calling with expletives. Before replying to him, I looked up his profile where he looked like a loser teenager and noticed that it was full of videos commemorating people like Timothy McVeigh (1995 Oklahoma City bomber), Nazis and the douchebags that shot up Columbine. I was absolutely disgusted by this and reported his videos, but eventually gave up after he wasn't banned from Youtube. I told myself that years later, I would be a successful engineer (which I currently am) and he's probably going to end up shooting up his school. I forgot about it then moved on. Later on that year, after completing a lab in university, I opened up Wikipedia and saw that there was a [school shooting in Finland with 8 people murdered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jokela_school_shooting). After scrolling through the article, there was a link to a mirror of the killer's Youtube profile. Right before clicking on it, I recalled that the loser I encountered earlier was also from that country. As it was confirmed that he was the mass-murderer, my heart sank and I couldn't help but be a mess in public. tl;dr Correctly predicted that a sicko on Youtube would end up becoming a mass murderer",

                    "body": "As a bit of background, I grew up on a farm in the midwest and on a Kinsey scale I'm about as gay as they come. Being a gay teenager in the early 2000's had its own set of challenges, so I stayed in the closet and used the internet as a way of talking to other gay men. I used to get on AIM chat rooms for gay men and used the whole a/s/l nonsense to perhaps find someone in my area to get to know better. I was like a teenage girl, wanting attention from any guy who would give it to me, but no one ever gave me a talk about the dangers of men online. I had to learn the hard way. One time I met someone very close to me online, which was exciting in its own right because finding someone within a 30 minute drive was like finding a needle in a haystack. We got to talking and he was pretty lewd, but I allowed it because he might actually be another gay man I could meet in person. Someone who could relate to what it's like. His sexual comments were flattering, and I fell for his advances. He talked me into giving him my home phone number and we would meet up soon. As an aside, I had no cell phone at this point in my life. So we agree to meet up in a Wal-Mart parking lot and I'm thinking about it all day. I know most people might see that as a red flag, but both of us are on our guard that the other isn't gay. Meeting in a public place is a bit safer for both of us because we can just walk away. That's what I figured at least. But as I get closer and closer to meeting up with him, I realize that this seems really sketchy and my sense of stranger danger started to kick in. I didn't go to meet him. I got online later and said I was sorry and that I couldn't go through with it. He seemed fine with it at first, but within a few days he messaged me and said that he had called my house and talked to my mom. He threatened to out me to my whole family if I didn't come to his house and have sex with him. I felt completely trapped. At that point in my life, I would have rather died than have my family know I was gay. So I resigned to the fact that he had blackmail on me, and I would have to do whatever he wanted. I had no friends who knew I was gay to talk to; I was too scared to ask my own family for help. I was alone. Well, almost alone. He wasn't the only person online that I had told I was gay. I had a few friends online that I had told I was gay. I confided in one of them about the situation and he told me to stand up to him and threaten to call the police. He told me that I had a right to say no. This was not normal. This was abuse. For the first time in the situation, I felt empowered. He was right, I didn't have to put up with this. If the worst this person could do is out me to my parents, fuck him I'll deal with that consequence. So, the next time I chatted with him he started talking dirty to me and telling me I had to come over soon or he was going to out me. I told him that I would *never* have sex with him and if he tried to contact me ever again I would call the police. He never talked to me ever again. TL;DR: I was a gay teenager in the early 2000s and met a sexual predator online. I didn't know how to deal with the situation and was very close to meeting him because of blackmail, but an online friend empowered me to stand up to his advances.",

I still am. I was playing my favorite game when I met a man that I'm gonna call Mike for privacy sake. Mike was 27 at the time we \"met\". I thought he was cool and funny; i was totally wrapped up in my crush on him. When I was 13 he asked me to be his \"girlfriend\". He was 28. I hate myself for not going to my parents but they were shitty and I was practically starving for love. For the next 5 years I was stuck dating Mike. He ended up being verbally and emotionally abusive. If he had ever met up with me in person I'm sure he would have physically abused me too. If I mentioned that a boy talked to me in school he'd flip out and accuse me of cheating, call me a stupid cunt and yell at me over the phone. If I hung up or ignored him things escalated. He manipulated me into sending nudes--the main reason I never reported him because I heard about that kid who got sentenced for CP *from his own nudes*. Every time I tried to break up with him he threatened to kill himself and I stupidly believed him. It got to the point though where he said that and I realized I didn't have any fucks left to give. So I said \"okay, do it.\" \"I WILL! I'LL FUCKING HANG MYSELF!\" \"I'm waiting\". He fumbled with his words a bit before I said goodbye, hung up, and proceeded to block him on everything. That was almost 4 years ago now. He still tries to make new YouTube or Facebook accounts and message me once in a while. The scariest part was right after the break up though. He really went psycho. Despite living in another state I was paranoid as all hell since he knew the area I lived in. If I heard a twig snap outside my window I was *certain* he was coming to kill me and then himself. Last I heard he was waiting sentencing for stabbing his brother. Wherever you are, Mike, go to hell TLDR; Ended up long distance dating a pretty much pedophile who was abusive as fuck and I learned a valuable lesson or 10",

This was around a year ago, but there used to be a person who was very popular on the server. On this server, everyone's pretty close, and it's easy to make friends. Most of my friends were from the game. It was believed though that this popular person was apparently an attractive girl, and they regularly told people they were. In truth, they were actually a guy who looked like a girl, and I'm not sure if they were truly trans or not, which isn't an issue of course, but they certainly used it to their advantage as you'll soon see. We'll call him 'M'. Anyway, M became close with a good friend of mine, who we'll call 'D', who happens to be underage. M got a lot of information out of D, with the pretense that she could be trusted because she was also a girl. M found out D's entire name and address and learned that D had done some things she regretted. M basically tried to blackmail D to sending nudes, or else they would message her parents about the stuff she told them. D was very depressed at the time, and I think M knew this, seeing her as an easy target. Thankfully, she told M to fuck off, but not without being hurt over it, obviously. Apparently M has done this to several different girls on the server, and one actually did send nudes. All the girls had some form of depression. I'm an older woman, and although I was somewhat friends with M, and we talked here and there, they thankfully never tried any of this shit with me. After this blew up, they pretty much disappeared, and stopped posting on their art pages. It's scary to think that even in such a friendly community there are predators like this trying to take advantage of emotionally upset people.",

One day I stumble across a girl who was pretty young. She was crying and saying how someone she thought was a friend was spreading lies on younow. I go find the other girl and she is saying nasty stuff, like \"I hate the bitch. I was only her friend so I could ruin her life easier.\" I was like damn that's cold. So I decided to step in. The mean girls username was her first and last name, she was also wearing a sweat shirt with her school's name on it. After a short Google search I found her Facebook and email accounts. I sent her an email telling her to be nicer. I then dug around and found out all sorts of random details, her number on the soft ball team, her dance clubs name, and her parents name and phone numbers, which after some more googling I found out where they worked. I then screen capped some mean stuff she had snap chatted the first girl (she showed her phone screen to the camera). I started telling her in the chat to calm down or I'd text her mom what she had been saying. She called my bluff and I sent her an email with all the information I had. Then in the younow chat I told her to check her emails, which she did. She started crying and apologizing. I ended up texting the mom the screen shots and then promptly blocked her number. I never found out the end of it but I hope the bullying stopped. It was scary to me how easy it was to find all that information. ",

So we're honest (because we're stupid), and just give the name of our town.

He was just some guy running a kiosk in a mall). Nope. This dude is 38 years old in a games room for kids 12-18. He's a soldier stationed in Minot (or taking his leave in Minot? Once again, so long ago), and now he know exactly where we are, how old we are, our first names, and starts talking about the layout of our town..and the color of our panties, the money he would bring us, the places he would take us if we could just get away from our parents, our panties again. The whole thing actually only took about five minutes, and after that my friend deleted her account and we never entered the domain of yahoo games again.

                    "body": "My ex convinced me to try out Second Life because she had so many friends on there. One of her friends was particularly weird. He instantly gifts me a penis in the game, tells me he's in love with my girlfriend, and then begs me for a threesome with us. In game or irl, I don't know what he meant, but the answer was no. After I broke up with my ex, he went full on crazy. It started with him making at least a dozen twitter accounts, tweeting harassing stuff about my sex life at me and anyone who followed me. He found out my email and started sending me death threats. I found out later that he told his friends in graphic detail how he wanted to \"get back\" at me to the point where his friends contacted the police. Fast forward a few months and I check my streetpasses on my 3ds to see this guy's username. For those who don't play video games, streetpass shows you the people you've passed by with a 3ds. Ended up calling the cops since I had reasonable suspicion that he was nearby and looking for me. Next day, the cops were at my door. Apparently the guy had been roaming my school's campus and my apartment complex looking suspicious. They took him in for questioning and from their time with him, they determined he's definitely crazy. They told me \"this guy is obsessed with you.\" Supposedly he had moved to my hometown thinking if he murdered me that my ex would suddenly fall for him. A few days later he was arrested for felony intimidation based on the evidence I provided. From what I heard from the court's office, he also fought the police and was charged with resisting arrest. He spent a week in jail then got off scott free because of \"mental disability.\" He began messaging my friends, asking them to ask me to have the protection order canceled and that he would reward them if I did. Each of his messages he sent made it clear that it was my fault he went to jail. It wasn't because of him stalking me or threatening to kill me, he felt that it was my fault. I think that's what made this even scarier: he wasn't taking responsibility for his actions, I was now a scapegoat for why things were going wrong for him and he was even more mad. I've still got a protection order against him, but when you're being followed by a crazy person you can't really be sure they'll follow the rules. Tl;Dr: My ex's Internet friend moved to my city to try and kill me to impress her **EDIT:** More reasons why he's a creepy guy: 1) My ex was thin and kind of flat chested. He told her that she was \"hot because she has the body of a 12 year old.\" 2) Before we started dating, he asked her for her address to send her a Christmas present. He mailed her a dragon dildo because his \"fursona\" is a dragon. 3) One day he showed up at her dorm out of the blue to visit. He said he had nowhere to stay, so she let him stay the night where he tried forcing himself on her. Thankfully she beat the shit out of him and kicked him out. This all happened before we dated and she still decided to remain friends with him. 4) According to my ex, he would regularly solicit nudes from her and a lot of his \"friends,\" most of whom are minors. Tldr v2: He's an attempted rapist and a pedophile.",

She was begging me to let her go with her friend \"to meet a Disney star\"...some actor from one of the shows they loved. She was rambling and excited and I couldn't quite piece together what was happening. Told her we'd talk about it when I got home. I'm thinking there's some meet and greet or event she wanted to go to. Oh no. Her friend (who, at 11 already had Instagram) believed she was communicating with this actor. He had sent her pictures of \"himself\" and wanted her to meet up with him at the park down the street from her house. She had given him some personal info about her and where she lived and he knew the name of the park he wanted to meet her at. These girls fell for it hook, line and sinker. I had her get her friend to send her screenshots of the pictures and conversation. We googled the actors name and the first 3 pictures that came up online are the pics this person sent her. It was disturbing. She began to see that this was a really dangerous situation. I called the girls mom to let her know what was going on and then forwarded the screenshots to a friend that works at the prosecutors office. This is why she is not allowed to have social media yet, even 2 years later. They're just too young to spot danger. I know I'm the lamest 7th grade mom these days because I won't let her have Instagram or snapchat (when 95% of them do) but I don't even care. It's my job to keep her safe. ",

It was definitely a weird relationship, but at least with 8 states between them I wasn't worried about accidental pregnancies. I was careful about it, insisting on video chat with the girl's parents when things started getting serious (if you can consider an online romance between two geeky 14 year olds \"serious\"). And either they were decent actors or they were perfectly normal people with a perfectly normal (and quite cute- way to go son!) daughter. I chose to believe the latter. It was actually fucking adorable. They'd have each other on video chat practically from the moment they got home from the moment they left for school the next day. They even kept the video going while they were sleeping. I'm pretty sure boobs and boyjunk images were exchanged, at least based on his fire engine red blush when I asked him what the folder \"lacypix\" (her name was Lacy) on his computer desktop screen had in it. We had a talk about that. Boundaries were set. One evening, my son came downstairs and told me he was worried about his girlfriend. She'd been talking about committing suicide a lot over the last couple of weeks. I looked at the chat logs, and it sounded more like standard teenage angst than real threats, but you don't fuck around with stuff like that so I asked my kid to set up a chat between me and her parents asap. Well, he somehow let slip that I wanted to talk to them about her threats to self-harm, and things went ballistic. She went and got a bunch of pills (this was still on video chat, remember). Then she ate them all right in front of her. And ended the chat session. The next hour and a half were the scariest online experience I have ever had. My son SPRINTED downstairs to tell me what had happened, and then we went crazy with calls to 911 (they had no idea what to do or even what the hell we'd been talking about. Nearly 15 precious minutes were wasted there, and another 10 when a cop and an ambulance showed up wanting to know where the person who had committed suicide was). While I handled the emergency services folks, my son was frantically searching google, people-finding web sites, combing through every chat log, poem, picture, etc. she had ever sent him. He finally found a picture of her from when she'd gone to the hospital to have her tonsils out. In the picture, she was holding up her arm with the patient tag on it. It had her full name, a medical record #, and the name of the hospital. Bingo! We looked up the hospital online and called their ER. Explanations took a while, and they flat-out refused to give me any information. But they did agree to cooperate if a uniformed police officer showed up. More on that later. At the same time, my kid was just getting on the phone with the sheriff's office for the county the hospital was in (smart kid- he'd tried the town police, but they wouldn't speak to him at all). Once the call had gotten started, I jumped in via speakerphone and went through the same yada yada yada I'd done with 911, the hospital, the cop, the ambulance driver, ... But this time the person on the other end of the phone listened. He was skeptical, but he agreed that it would make sense to err on the side of caution. So he called up the cops stationed at the hospital (which apparently is a thing in some places, who knew?) and had them go talk to the ER nurse I'd just hung up on. Now, the conclusion to this story is a lot less exciting than everything leading up to it. The ER nurse released the girl's home address, and they sent a cop and an ambulance out there immediately. But as is often the case, it had mostly been a case of teenage drama. The girl had either faked taking the pills or intentionally vomited them up immediately afterward. They still took her to the ER and did whatever kind of checking up they do, but they sent her home soon after. We got an email from her parents thanking us for taking Lacy's threats seriously and telling us that it had (thank God!) only been threats. But they asked that I not let my son continue to communicate with her, and said they'd told her to un-friend her (or the equivalent) from all their chat/video/whatever services. I talked to him about it, and he agreed that it would be a good idea. We let them say goodbye via one last (highly supervised) video chat, where she apologized to us and other than a few tears on both their parts, that was the end of it. Never heard from or about her since. And while all that trouble was unnecessary, it doesn't mean that the panic and anxiety that went into it weren't real. My son and I were legitimately thinking that if we couldn't figure out what to do and how to do it, a teenage girl was going to die. It was a horrible, awful, frightening few hours, and I went many nights without sleep because my brain would let go of what might have happened if her threats had been real and we hadn't been able to sleuth out her details. If I had a \"lessons learned\" to share from this experience it would be this: Having your kids' friends' parents' contact info is as important for their online friends as it is for their irl ones. At 14, he was a little old for me to insist on that kind of thing, but damn I really wish I had. It would have saved a lot of time and panic. tl;dr: Fifteen year old son had an online girlfriend. She threatened suicide & then appeared to go through with it. Son and I spent the next 90min or so learning that it's fucking hard to dox someone. Ended up S.W.A.Tting (well E.M.T.ing) the girl. Turned out she'd faked it or chickened out. End of story & end of relationship. ",

I was shocked at first but then I was like \"I dont even save porn, its the 21st century who the fuck does that anymore?\" And then realized the FBI wouldnt extort me like that if I did have that. I booted in safe mode, loaded an older save of my computer and never saw it again.",

They then started making their own changes to the page, like what my favourite movies were etc, and some new photos started popping up on there. As far as I remember, there was at least one new photo of me that was taken in public, at school or a social situation or something that I wasn't aware was being taken, and a bunch of other random stuff that had nothing to do with me. I think it was probably a friend trying to fuck with me, but I never found out who.

A male coworker of hers would offer her rides home occasionally and she just thought he was being nice. Her friend sent her something from 4chan about a guy who really liked a coworker and had fantasies about raping her. He made a whole plan about how he wanted to do it one night when he drove her home from work. He posted pictures of her too. I don't remember the ending but I think the guy was fired. Not sure if there was ever any legal action taken.",

Then out of the silence, a calm automated woman says, \"Goodbye.\" and hangs up. I almost shit a brick. Did some Googling and discovered [it's happened to other people to.](http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1469494) I was less worried after that. EDIT: also to the people in this thread, this just happens sometimes. I don't know why but I've seen it happen and it's happened to me as well.

So I would basically go into a couple of Yahoo chat rooms all day and just sit behind the desk in case customers actually came in. I'd also check my email pretty regularly. This was about 12 years ago now. Those rooms are long gone. My boss, who was about a year or two younger than me, would just randomly blurt out things in an apparent attempt to be supportive that would would throw me off guard because I barely talked to anyone and certainly not to him as he was a bit of a moody verbally abusive ass-hole. It was just the shit he said would be things from emails I'd sent. I had a long, years long, history of email pen pals and had everything saved in folders. When I quit my password was changed by someone else and when I finally managed to get logged in someone had deleted everything. Oh what a mystery as to who it could have been.",

I was a pretty messed up kid, very \"wierd\" in every way. No friends, family was upside down, but since my neighbor molested me I knew at least my body was valuable for attention. Edit: To everyone who reached out to me in PMS, that kindness is really wonderful. I'm a mostly normal adult now, with an amazingly caring boyfriend who really gets me. To all the other kids out there who went through something similar, don't be afraid to talk about it to someone. Letting it out is how you grow, you don't have to let your past define you, your worth or your sexual future. Https://hotline.rainn.org/online/terms-of-service.jsp also going to leave this here.

He said again, 'MS-DOS'. I asked him to show me and he began, straight forwardly enough at the time, by navigating to a working sub-directory. He then proceeded to create file after file after file. It turned out he was using DOS as a filing system, creating individual records by creating corresponding files. He wrote nothing in the file, all his information was contained in his choice of filenames and extensions. It all worked. It did what he wanted, but it had put him at the limit of what a DOS file system could handle at the time. ",

It requires the user to download the mainframe files, sign on to the remote site, and upload the files. The process takes place seven or eight times a year. I documented it step by step. I explained it to my manager and the user's manager. They agreed the process is logical and straightforward. I showed the end-users how to do it. They seemed to understand. Three years later and I was still changing the documentation to account for all the ways the users found to NOT FOLLOW THE STEP-BY-STEP DOCUMENTATION. Nearly every billing run was screwed up because they found new and interesting ways to fuck up. \"Click with the left button. No, not the right. Why are you double-clicking? Why are you double-clicking so slow? Why are you double-right-clicking? Mashing the mouse button does not make the computer understand what you meant to do. Try not to move the mouse halfway across the screen when you click (oh, that last one should have been an acceptable defense for justifiable homicide).\" All these issues result in bizarre web form behavior. And that was just the clicking. If they got the clicking right, it was WHAT they were clicking inside and outside the browser window that screwed it all up. BTW, the process takes place in the middle of the night and they would either call me (read: wake) so I could walk them through it (bad), or not call me and our billing would be delayed (worse because the billing data was dated; guess who had to do damage control on the data to fix the issue.) 20 years later and one of the users STILL calls me to walk him through it. At least now, the process takes place during the work day and I can be on hand to help.",

I'm not *just* talking about not knowing how to use (let alone create) templates in Word, or how to save files to a thumbdrive, or backup your data (though that's crazy too) or know there are other browsers besides Explorer. It's way worse. I told one person that their list of citations needs to be alphabetical, and rather than mark it and drag and drop they started retyping it. Heck, a lot of them didn't know how to cut and paste in general. I've seen people who didn't know you can hold down Shift to get an uppercase letter. They'd activate capslock, hit the letter, deactivate capslock. And one person. One person would write entire essays on paper, then type them in. Then, if they needed to edit it, they'd *do it on the original paper version* and then *type the entire thing back in from scratch*. **EDIT**: I'm getting many, many replies about the capslock thing. Apparently a *lot* of people do that. Note that I'm not talking about people who do this in the flow of typing, I'm talking about \"Stop Typing, Hit Caps Lock, Hit One Key, Hit Caps Lock, Resume Typing\" kind of situations. ",

Suffice to say, everyone is 100% computer retarded. -One of my users was once enraged that the MSN homepage changed and insisted I needed to change it back to the old design. -When we deployed Office 2013, my phone rang off the hook from people claiming they didn't have email, word, powerpoint, etc anymore. Really it was just that the desktop shortcut was gone. When I tell them that the shortcut is gone and you need to click the start button and find it in their programs to start it for the first time, they were blown away that other programs exist on their computer that don't have big magical buttons on their desktop. I was really depressed for a while about this entire concept. I am surrounded by people who think a computer is just one set screen with big buttons on it to press and thats it. -People call all the time saying their computer is broken. I ask if its turned on. They say no. -I have users who cannot remember a series of digits on a day to day basis, so they write down their RSA pin on the plastic RSA token. -I know of several users who do not email. Their secretaries are tasked with printing out every email they receive & placing them in piles on the users desk. The user writes back in pen on the email. The secretary types it up as a response to the email and sends it. Your tax dollars at work folks. Bonus round for my mental health: -One of my coworkers that does IT support does not know how to replace the printer ink and instead books a lexmark tech every time a cartridge needs installation. A lexmark tech out of warranty is about $450 for 30 mins. -Another office hired a head of IT and he came to my office to shadow or something. He tried to book a 30 minute meeting with me so I could \"teach him how to computer code some software\" after hearing about some script i wrote. He fully expected to learn to code in 30 minutes. ",

She was new to the Internet (in her 50's) and online shopping. She had just finished shopping online and went to checkout. When it asked for her credit card information (rather than typing it in) she tried swiping her card a few times in the floppy drive until it got stuck. 2. Much older gentleman came in complaining that his \"coffee cup holder\" on his tower had broken. Very confused my uncle had him bring the pc in to see what he was talking about. The guy had been using his cd rom drive as a mug older for his coffee everytime he used the computer and it finally snapped.",

I didn't think anything of it but said fine, told my dad what the exact problem was with the laptop and to explain it to him clearly. My dad gave him the laptop the next time he saw him and it was 2 weeks before I got it back. When my dad finally brought it home he said \"it's all fixed\" and i was buzzing to finally use it again. Except the charger port was STILL bust. Also theirs an open hatch at the bottom of my laptop that lets me see inside?! AND THE GUY HAD WIPED MY ENTIRE MEMORY. All my schoolwork, all my games, all my music. I was fucking livid, this guy had managed to sabotage my laptop even more?! Worst thing about it is that when I complained to my dad he didn't understand and kept arguing back that it was fixed \"because the guy said it was\". I explained to him it's like going to get your bike fixed because the brakes are bust and they just rip one of your wheels off and give it back. TL;DR - My Laptop charger port was bust.

These officers had never used a computer in their life, and it was stunning how difficult it was for them to grasp the concept that, for a double click, you have to hold the mouse steady while clicking. The action of clicking would make them move the mouse, so they'd end up dragging-and-dropping the icon instead of double-clicking. All this to say, proper double-clicking, while instinctive to us, is actually an acquired skill. On a side note, I have a sneaking suspicion those computers we gave them started collecting dust and were never used again the moment we left country. They got the basic functions down, but none of them had the required skill to troubleshoot or do much of anything the first time there was a problem.",

For the same reason, interface appearance changes, rearrangements, and rewordings from updates throw them off. I've been trying to keep that in mind lately. If I'm speaking with someone over the phone and I get that vibe, I'll try to throw in some explanations or tell them how to swap tabs and retrieve what they \"lost.\" For them, it's like only having turn-by-turn directions to get somewhere instead of knowing the general layout of the streets.

Please put plastic bags around all of the telephone receivers so the dust doesn't blow out into your office. I wonder how many people fell for this. Another one was to call up someone and say you're from the phone company and that we have to do work on your line. It might make your phone ring a couple times but under no circumstances should you pick it up because the technician is connected to your line and the electricity could be dangerous. They agree and you call back a minute later. Let the phone ring until they pick it up. Start screaming in agony when they do.",

You can instantly access this data of yours. This is an age without the download button. I bet we all will be looking for download buttons when this time comes.

Problem is, the microfilm readers are connected to computers nowadays. So I started to show him, and it was apparent that he had *never* used one. The cursor went right off the screen every time he touched the mouse. He didn't even double click everything, he didn't realize what I meant by \"click here\". Two hours later he needs help again. He'd managed to find the right part of the film, zoom in on the part he needed and enhance the image. But he didn't have the code for the printer. All I thought was \"This guy probably learned to ride a horse, hunt for food, drive a car, and build a house all by himself. I shouldn't be surprised.\"",

She had to wait in line and took the opportunity to start \"warning\" my other customers about what scam artists we supposedly were. Finally I snapped and asked what's the problem, and she goes \"MY KIDS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF ME ALL WEEK! YOU SAID I WOULDNT HAVE SERVICE FOR AN HOUR BUT IT HAS BEEN A WHOLE WEEK!\" I looked at her phone, and sure enough there's like 5 missed calls from her kids. I asked to to show me how she answers the phone, and of course she uses her finger and BANGS into the screen as hard as possible, which doesn't work and she goes \"SEE???\" so I explain the right way to touch the screen, and that I can't refund her because there's nothing wrong with it. So she storms out. Then comes back in 3 minutes later: \"I JUST TRIED TO CALL MY BANK AND IT SAID THE NUMBER COULD NOT BE COMPLETED AS DIALED! FIX. MY. PHONE. NOW!!\" so I look at her call history.....SHE DIALED HER 16-DIGIT CREDIT CARD NUMBER, NOT THE PHONE NUMBER ON THE BACK. Ugh. People.",

And if you want me to give you social media specific ones, I can do that, too.

Several of these tasks involved faxing things. After politely paying attention to all of this training, I emailed each person on the receiving end of any of these faxed materials. I asked if they needed it faxed or if it was okay if I just scanned and emailed the documents. Mercifully each one said that was fine to send by email, and they'd actually prefer it. Also, fax machines: *so much more secure* to send that sensitive information to sit in the fax machine tray unattended for a week until someone remembers to check it.",

This was before on-screen programming where you had to use tiny pushbuttons on the front of the VCR itself. It took forever to set up the program for her. A couple of weeks later she calls to have me come over and redo the whole thing because it isn't working any more. Why not? The VCR had lost its programming and the clock was blinking 12:00. Figured it was because of a power outage and redid everything. Repeat this every couple of weeks for about six months. Finally got it out of her that every so often she would unplug the VCR because the \"Glasses would start flashing\" at her and she didn't know what it meant. Took a while to figure out that the \"glasses\" were the videotape icon that indicated that a tape was inserted. When it ran out of space on the tape it would eject and flash the icon because there was a timer set and no tape left to record on. She'd see the flashing and unplug it to make it stop. Of course, this is the same woman who would fall dead asleep in the middle of her beloved MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour (I think she had a thing for Robert MacNeil) and wake up in the middle of Miami Vice after I'd changed the channel and it would take her a good ten minutes to realize she wasn't watching the news any more.",

In some homes, having a guest that doesn't provide a lot of feedback (think mhmms and yeahs) or few interruptions suggests that the guest is cold, distant and disinterested. In reverse, a person used to those norms will be considered rude and overly talkative and inconsiderate by cultures that expect a slower flow of conversation. Typically nordic cultures are known to appreciate silences between speakers as opposed to American speakers (the subject of volume is related to this too, as addressed in another comment) Adding more: It's important to note that this is a sliding scale, and people should try their best to recognize when somebody that appears rude is actually trying to be involved in the conversation in the way that they find polite! You're an example of someone that provides high feedback, and your interruptions actually betray your interest I the conversation. Keep in mind that your conversational style isn't wrong, it's just your style, you just might want to tailor it to your current situation ",

This results in the sandwich completely falling apart before the 2 final, best, juiciest bites are able to be consumed. If one were to hold the sandwich the other way, however, with 4 fingers on the bottom to disperse all that weight over, I would assume the longevity of the bottom bun would be extended quite a bit.",

Several years later, I visited my nephew who was living in Majorca, Spain. He warned me that our normal American volume was considered loud to the natives, so we should speak more quietly.

Years later I moved back in with family to pay off college loans and found that he was still living with his parents half the year, while teaching private surfing lessons and lifeguarding, and spending the other half of the year surfing below the equator. We meet up. At one point I mentioned how I'm glad he got over a lot of his shyness, it was a shame in high school so many of us had crushes on him. He was shocked. *Me? Handsome?* Yeah, bro. Very much so. He didn't believe me at first, and made me name some people who had crushes on him. I watched as the comprehension of his beauty penetrated through whatever he'd put up to block it. I met up a year later and found out he still occasionally did lifeguarding at private parties, but was primarily acting, and driving for Uber in between. My spouse joked, \"Oh, so you finally went into the professionally handsome business?\" He laughed and agreed. It was amazing to see how much he'd changed. Highschool him would have buried his head in embarrassment. Three years later and he's just acting, and getting a fair of gigs, all of which he seems to be cast for his handsomeness. His confidence and self esteem seem have completely changed. I feel like a changed a childhood friend's life for the good by pointing out the obvious one day. ",

I know (particularly during a disagreement) I respond poorly to \"you\" statements (like, \"YOU did this or that\"), but an \"I feel\" statement gets me listening again, with an open heart, and expressing empathy for their feelings (whether I am the cause of their feelings or not). I hope that if you ever try opening up (and you should! for your sake, and the sake of those who love you), you're met with enough patience from the person you're speaking to to be silent and let you get it out.

But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness\"",

Not everything qualifies for the cashback (food court, travel, etc.) but seriously you spend $5.5k and it's just paid for your year of membership. If you're somewhere vacationing like Hawaii and don't have a Costco near your home location, go in, get a membership, buy what you want (including alcohol, some great prices in Hawaii) cancel it (in person or I think you can do it over the phone, but if you're only going once why not stop by customer service on your way out.) and get the membership fee refunded. The Kirkland (Costco brand) diaper wipes are the best around - large, cloth like and seriously hard to accidentally tear through when using them to clean around the house, unscented, only need one or two vs a handful for super messy baby faces and bottoms. The rotisserie chicken is at least 3lbs and $5. Their bakery is the best of the regular stores and warehouses. The organics are cheap for organics.",

If you buy an expensive mattress in a store you're paying more than 4x what it cost to make, and there really isn't any correlation between mattress price and quality of sleep. The belief that you need to spend a lot to get a good mattress is fairly new, and mostly a result of aggressive marketing campaigns by Tempur-Pedic and Sleep Number. Brands like Tempur-Pedic are bordering on scam levels. They're consistently ranked as among the least comfortable foam mattresses by sources like Consumer Reports, despite costing double to triple the competition. And while I appreciate the desire to buy a mattress that will last a long time, your sleep needs (i.e firmness, heat generation) change over time. I really recommend you check out mattress review sites like [Sleep Like the Dead](http://www.sleeplikethedead.com/). My advice advice for buying cheap mattresses is Ikea, and my advice for buying high-end mattresses is an online brand like [Casper](https://casper.com/) or [Saatva](http://www.saatvamattress.com/). Good luck!",

I also build condos (I'm an electrician), and most of them don't have power feeds to the building that have been sized to handle vehicle charging. I did one building recently that had enough capacity for 25% electric vehicles, and another that had capacity for 0%. Projections I've heard are that nearly all new vehicles sold will be electric in 10 years, so I don't understand how people expect the infrastructure to be in place by then, unless it's all done at dedicated charging facilities.

If you have a girth of 4.9-5.4\" you'll be mostly fine, but if you're smaller than that condoms will be at risk of slipping off, and if you're bigger than that condoms will restrict bloodflow and reduce your ability to have sex, and be at a higher risk of breaking. So order from somewhere like MySize or TheyFit where you can get a broader range of sizes. This used to be illegal in the US, but now I think TheyFit can ship directly to the US without pretending to be gloves. Aim for a size that's a bit smaller than your girth by maybe 15% or so, and maybe 0.5\" longer than your length (or more if you're uncircumcised, depends on the foreskin). ",

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet. This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\u201d",

What will give you a better night's sleep is finding a mattress you're really comfortable on. If you want to buy online, make sure whatever mattress you're buying has some sort of return policy that has no restocking fee or anything like that. If you go into a store, there likely won't be a 100% money back option, but you should have a trial period that you can test the mattress out(my store offers 90 days) and if within that trial period you decide you want something a little firmer or a little softer then an exchange can be arranged and the difference paid for the bed. If you decide to go the store route, which you may want to do anyway if you plan on buying online just so you can see how different mattresses can feel, be prepared to lay down, ask questions if you have them and don't feel pressured(I recommend going to a locally owned place, the lack of corporate training means you're less likely to have a high pressure salesperson). Another thing, is only bring people who are sleeping on the bed, your mother or best friend liking a mattress will have no effect on how you feel on it and third party input can really throw you off. I know it can be awkward to go in by yourself and lay around in front of strangers, but it's the way to do it.",
