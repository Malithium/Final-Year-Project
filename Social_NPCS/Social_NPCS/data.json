                    "body": "I was waiting in line for a ferry in WA state. In case you've not done it there is a big parking lot and everyone waits in their cars till you load up on the ferry. The guy next to me obviously does not know I am looking at him and he turns around and smacks the shit out of a crying 2 year old while his 6-7 year old daughter is watching. He hit him 7-8 times in a pure rage style beating. He looks over and notices I am watching and tries to pretend nothing happened. I get out of my truck and start to head over to the bomb dog cop they have around. As I am heading over there he runs up stops me and asks me what I think I am doing. I kept trying to get around him without a confrontation, he kept pushing me but I was able to sneak by so he tripped me. I got up walked into plain view of the officer and the dude punches me in the back of the head then spit in my face. The officer saw all of this and came up and put the guy in cuffs. All of this is in view of the small children in his car. So I took a punch and got spat in my face but in the end the children were taken into protective custody and I pressed full charges. There was another witness to the guy hitting the kid and they had security footage of the guy assaulting me so I didn't even have to go to court! Edit: I am no hero, a bit of a prick actually. But you hurt a kid, I will follow up and make sure you get yours. Also for the gold givers...take that shit back I don't want it. ",

I refused service to her, and the manager ended up ringing her up. She was paying with mostly pennies and nickels, and while she was distracted I saw the boy walk over to the candy rack and wipe the tears from his eyes. I asked him what was wrong and he told me it had taken him three years to save that money, but his mom didn't have a job so she took it from him. I bought him the candy bar he wanted and gave him a bunch of quarters for the gumball/toy machines.

He seemed perfectly happy, it wasn't making any noise or bouncing around or anything, it wasn't bothering anyone. He was just bouncing and catching his ball as he walked. The woman (I assume it was his mom) noticed this after a minute, spun around and grabbed him hard by the upper arm and then shouted right into his face \"If you keep bouncing that fucking ball I'm going to SMASH YOUR FUCKING FACE IN\", shook him hard once and then just turned around and walked on with the pushchair. The poor kid just looked so... emptied. Like he wasn't even allowed this one small pleasure. It doesn't matter how annoying you find it when your kid bounces a ball, that's just never an ok thing to say to your child. Edit to add: This wasn't in a parking lot, it was in a pedestrianised plaza area out front - small inner city supermarket next to a library and other stores.

A boy (13yo?) was bullying kids on an indoor climbing cave and just claimed to his mom (when another boy started crying after he fell) that he slipped and bumped into the other boy by accident. Mom totally believes it and goes back to ignoring her son climbing and instead chatting and drinking lattes with her two friends. Bully targets a young girl on the wall (she's 9 I'm pretty sure) and grabs at her leg once he's creeped up beside her. She manages to kick his arm off and starts climbing upwards. He goes upwards to follow. What bully doesn't know is that the girl is a regular climber at our gym. It's about here when I notice the two and move towards them yelling at them to stop. Nearish to the top the boy lunges at the girl as she pretty deftly maneuvers away from his arm and he loses his balance and takes the 15 some feet dive to the ground. There is a pretty massive crack that can be heard along with his wailing in pain. And what does the mother do? She turns to the front desk and screams at the top of her lungs \"I AM GOING TO SUE YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU OWN\". BRAV-fucking-O, lady. I'd like to have pretended that I fist bumped the girl for a job well done, but I was checking in on the bully to make sure he wasn't going to die (colles fracture, no worries).",

He came back to the car without any and said he didn't have the right amount of money, and she hurled all sorts of abuse \"I've given you the right fucking amount, now fuck off back in to the shop and get the fucking food\" Then a few minutes later he comes back to the car, soaking wet, with a bag of food, and she starts yelling that \"He better have gotten the fucking order right, because it doesn't fucking look right\" And she yells at him to get in the car and she just speeds off.

Long story short, parents expect the lifeguards to do their job for them- either they just drop their kids off, or they don't pay attention. Background- this was a city pool. We didn't have too many terrible things, but we still saw our fair share of weird shit. Begin. This guy, let's call him Guy, probably late twenties early thirties, dove head first into the pool. The kiddie pool (very, very shallow). I saw it, blew the whistle, and gave him a head shake. He acknowledged, rubs his chest because he scraped it on the bottom, and I thought it was over with. 5 minutes later, he dives head first into the kiddy section of the pool (2 feet). I blow the whistle, call him over, and talk to him sternly about how I'm not reprimanding him for any other reason than that I don't want to have to backboard him for a spinal. Guy agrees, says it was stupid, apologizes and walks away. Cue fuck up number 3. Guy walks away from me, over to this 6 foot water slide we have for the little kids. This is the cutest water slide, but still towers over its primary users- 2 year olds. Along his way to the slide, Guy scoops up what I assume is his son, and puts him at the top of the slide- still standing up. This kid couldn't be more than 2-3 years old, had floaties on and all. Guy points at me, and over the regular pool ruckus, I hear him yell \"See that lifeguard? He told me he wants you to jump off the side of the slide.\" He then proceeds to point at the concrete. I see the kids knees buckle as he goes to jump, and my heart sinks like a rock to my stomach. I immediately shoot out of my chair and yell \"HEYYYY!\". 2 things of note: 1. As a guard, you're never to stand on your tower unless you see someone in apparent danger. This is so other guards have a clear sign that something's going down, and to pay attention/get help. 2. I have a deep voice. A VERY deep voice. I'm quiet often, but when I get pissed, I utilize it to my advantage. What one of my friends later described as \"The Voice of God\" echos put across the pool, and the entire place falls quiet. Guy immediately puts his son down on the ground and starts walking towards me. I call over my manager, explain it all, and she (not the brightest of managers) tells him he will be removed by the police after any other incidents. He apologizes, then goes on about his pool experience. 2 hours later, I'm in the 5 foot section (Deepest aside from the 12-20 foot sections). Guy is walking along with friends, sees me in the chair, and goes \"Watch this.\" I'm still surprised he didn't say \"Hold my beer\" instead. He runs and dives in really deep. Fuck up numero cuatro, reporting for duty. In front of his son, who was behind the legs of some other bro and peeks out after his dad submerges, Guy floats up to the surface of the pool- face down and unresponsive. We had to evacuate the pool, stabilize and backboard him. Guy kept entering his name into Darwin's Lottery, and won. TL;DR: Guy disobeys lifeguard. Guy gets son involved. Guy shows off for friends/son. Guy breaks neck.",

All 3 are single file following him while staring at the ground and not saying a word. Then a 4th kid, maybe 17, walks up holding a printed tshirt that's on clearance for $4 and he says \"hey dad, this is only $4...\" and before he can say another word the dad steps up toe to toe on him, snatches the shirt out of his hand and throws it on the ground and says in a hushed gravely teeth-cliched yell \"why the fuck would I spend money for you on a goddamn tshirt when you don't even do the laundry!\". To put this in perspective the dad is maybe 5'5\" and about 130lbs, the 17yo son is a good 6'4\"+ and well over 200lbs. I stood a couple feet away from them waiting for the son to lay out his dad but instead the son says \"sorry\" while staring at the ground and the dad begins to excoriate his son and the other 3 kids with increasing volume and intensity for nearly a minute. I mean calling them everything under the sun to the point where the three younger ones are crying and the oldest son has turned around and refuses to look at his screaming father. The dad took exception to that and is circling his oldest while grabbing at his face to force him to look him in the eyes. So me and another guy step in and I say \"hey, calm down buddy it's a $4 shirt, you're losing your mind over nothing. Look at your kids crying dude, why put them through this for a $4 shirt?\" And he just stares at me with this facial expression I've never seen before and says \"you are not my family and you are not allowed to intervene on my family matters\" which just set me off so I got right up to his short little face and with a big smile I said \"you have two children that are already much bigger than you, soon it's going to be four and it's only going to be a matter of time before one of them whoops your ass you arrogant fuck and you better hope it's only one\". He stands there shocked, mouth agape then looks at his oldest son and says \"don't get any fucking ideas, dumbass\" and we all went our separate ways. A year later I see in the news that the 14yo shot the dad when he walked in on him beating the mother. The dad didn't die but all the kids got taken from the home. I know the 17yo who is 23 now, super super messed up dude, very sad. ",

Anyway, the kid is being a normal 4-5 year old at a restaurant, kind of moving around in his chair talking a lot, nothing that would've been a problem for any normal person. That is everyone except his dad. Keep in mind, the father is extremely short (maybe 5'3\"ish? Just a guess his feet weren't touching the ground in a regular chair). Every time his son would do move or talk the dad would start screaming at the kid. Sometimes it would be telling him to shut up, and other times it would be actual yelling. It was clear which one was the more behaved. So the parents of the wife are looking on in horror and the wife is having one of those \"goddamit not again\" moments. Then the father took it too far. He actually started swinging his feet at the kid trying to shut him up, and this isn't like the guy next to you is talking too loud so you gently tap his leg, it was full-fledged rapid kicking. Pretty disgusting to watch, especially considering it being in public with people all around. On a lighter note, every time the guy swung his feet, they wouldn't reach the kid because he was so short, and at times he was slipping out of his chair trying to reach the kid. Meanwhile my dad and I are looking on and cracking up watching this tiny jackass fail to be an abusive father and he ended up trying to come over and yell at us, but when my dad and I stood up we were both much taller than him, so we laughed some more. He then retreated to his table and sat the entire time mumbling to himself and thankfully ignoring his family. After that we had the cops come because he actually ended up hitting his kid and the wife much earlier, and I really hope that is no longer a family. TL;DR: Abusive father got laughed at and probably arrested",

                    "body": "I truly don't try to judge other parents because parenting is fucking hard. But, my god, I want to just yell at my sister-in-law and her husband sometimes. My nephew is one of the single worst children I've ever seen and they don't seem to acknowledge any of it. A few years ago I was picking my kids up from my mother-in-law's house (she watches the grandchildren when everyone is at work) and my daughter informs me that my nephew bit her. She pulls up her shirt and shows me the Band Aids which are over the bite mark that broke skin. The kids bit her so hard through her sweater that she started bleeding. It was about this time that my sister-in-law arrived to pick up her kids and asked what was going on. My nephew starts bawling his eyes out and she starts consoling him telling him no one is mad at him. I corrected her and said I'm actually quite angry. I'm not sure he ever received any punishment for that. I'm still angry over it. Then a year or so later he starts preschool and started throwing tantrums whenever he had to go. I never personally witnessed them but from my understanding they were quite bad. Their solution was to unenroll him. My nephew is a preschool drop out. I asked if they were concerned that he was going to do the same thing when he starts kindergarten and they were certain it was just a phase. Well kindergarten started back in September and the tantrums have been quite regular. Another gem comes from one time when I was baby sitting this kid. He wanted to play Mario Kart on the Wii. I say sure and the two of us play along with my daughter. He plays at his house so he's quite competent with the game, although not terribly good. He's throwing a fit saying our game is broken because he was getting last place. When his dad came by to pick him up I told him about it and his response was that they have the computer controlled racers turned off at home so he can win. First off I didn't even know that was possible. Second off, you're setting your child up for a really rough life if you wont even let him lose in fucking Mario Kart. Keep the AI on, and he will learn the game and get better. Your kid needs to fail sometimes in order to learn and get better. I know it's just a video game but that is almost entirely the point. IT'S JUST A VIDEO GAME. What are you going to do when he might fail at something meaningful? The last story comes from a family vacation we took last summer. It was all of my wife's family, so fifteen people. We all went to Wisconsin Dells and the kid was awful the entire time. If he didn't want to do something he sure as hell made us aware of it. We went to a water park and all he wanted to do was hang out in the most basic pool. He didn't want to do water slides, or go in one that had any fun stuff to play with. I kept explaining to him that my kids want to hang out with you but they also want to see some of the other stuff. They didn't want to hang out in a pool that is exactly the same as the one down the road from our house. Then if we wanted to do any other attraction he threw a fit and his mother pretty much said they weren't going to do it. She didn't want to spend money on something her son wouldn't like. She eventually had kind of meltdown and yelled at all of us because she was apparently the villain of the trip. Nobody was trying to vilify you. We just suggested that maybe you should expose your kid to more things. This was a family vacation and we want to do stuff as a family and you're saying no to everything because you want to keep one person out of the fifteen of us happy. By no means am I the perfect parent, nor are my kids perfect by any metric. But I take great comfort in knowing that I didn't wind up with a kid like my nephew. This is the worst fucking teenager I've ever been exposed to and he's only six.",

I come out of the bathroom having heard all the commotion and all the adults were gone chasing after whoever it was. So now I am stuck with like 5 kids, I am drunk and tired as hell. I threw rockband back on and gave all the kids instruments. Had to unplug a couple but we still managed to make it through the next 20 minutes or so.

Well, they didn't disappoint here, either; my grandparents bought them talking dinosaurs that communicated with each other if they were close enough (pretty cool toys for two boys into dinosaurs.) The older of the two starts pitching a FIT because his brother got the dinosaur he wanted. I'm talking on the ground, kicking, screaming, crying, etc. for about 2 hours because he wanted the T. Rex. It culminated in his parents running to Walmart to buy another T. Rex to give the little snot so he'd be happy.

They had only recently gotten back in touch. It was an awkward week, to say the least. It started out with older sister bawling her eyes out when Dad left (she barely ever gets to see him), and continued on to her and younger sister fighting constantly. Obviously we don't know what kind of parenting goes on at home, but the girls both had serious issues with hygiene, and younger sister would routinely shit her pants and hide it under older sister's bed, then blame older sister for it. Midway through the week we called home to let the parents know we couldn't keep the sisters in the same tent anymore because they were constantly screaming and upsetting each other and their tent mates, and the parents lost their shit. They insisted that the girls needed to learn to get along or Dad wouldn't even bother to try and reconcile with older sister's family. I'm so glad I didn't have to make that call, because I don't know what I would have said to that. We moved them out of the same tent and kept them separate as much as possible without telling their parents. I don't know what ended up happening, but at the pick up brunch I saw Dad sitting with younger sister and her mom at one table, and older sister and her mom just left early.",

My Dad used to really lose his shit with me and kick my ass and scream at me since I was really little but that's the first time he ever tried to do lasting physical damage. Until I was 10, my older (by 9 years) half-brother used to beat my ass when they were out at the weekend. My arms are still slightly disfigured. My mother kicked me out at 16 (\"Fuck off and never come back\") after she spent years trying to kill herself by starvation and I was her carer. When I was 18 and visiting my mother, my girlfriend thought she was pregnant and she wanted me to take her to go get a test. My mother (without knowing why I was going out) screamed at me for a while, grabbed me with her nails and tore my wrists, then screamed that I was hitting/hurting her so that her boyfriend in the next room would think I was attacking her. I managed to get out the other door of my house by lifting my mother out the way. My newest stepdad is not only a heroin addict who beat all his kids too, but he's also my wife's father, meaning after 3 years of being together, I'm now technically married to my stepsister.",

I'm thinking \"this guy's fucked\", but the car in front of me reacts instantly and slams in his brakes and manages to swerve around the back end of the cyclists bike. After the commotion we both make it through the green and get stopped at the next intersection. The cyclists sees this, changes course and pedals fast to get up to the car in front of me. He starts punching the cars window and spitting on it and kicks the door and the rides off. It was surreal. He made a huge mistake by running a red and the only reason he wasn't seriously hurt was because of the good driving done by the guy I was following.

One day the grandparents came over to babysit and brought a new kiddie pool. The boy had played in a kiddie pool as a baby the previous summer, but of course he doesn't remember that, he's two. So the grandparents set up their gift, fill it with water, and I got the kids changed. I'd always stay an hour or so after the grandparents arrived to make sure the kids were comfortable with them first. Grandpa was so excited for little boy to see the gift... but the little boy wasn't sure about it, because he's basically never seen a pool before. I started getting him used to it, put his sister in, dipped my toes in, encouraged him to put his hand out and feel the water, etc. It was taking time, but he was warming up. Well, grandpa ran out of patience. He grabbed the kid and just plopped him into the pool. Little boy immediately started panicking and crying, and **then** grandpa started mocking him for crying about \"a little water\". I took the kiddo inside and told his parents what happened.

He staggers over to the woman with it, so proud of himself, going, \"Mum! Mum! Look what I'm doing! Mum! Look! Mum! Look what I'm doing! Look, Mum!\" Eventually, she tears her eyes away from the screen and sees what he's doing. She screams at him, \"Put that down now! You can't do that! What are you doing!? Put it back where it came from! Don't pick it up again!\" The kid was all flustered, trying to do what he was told, while the RAC man quietly took it from him and gave him a sympathetic pat on the shoulder. Also, a mother who was saying her young toddler wouldn't go to sleep at night. She handed him a beaker of something while we were talking and I asked what he was drinking-- tea. I looked surprised and she apparently thought I was surprised by a toddler liking tea and she was like, \"They like it if you put a couple of sugars in! He always wants it now!\" I explained that maybe the caffeine wasn't helping him sleep and she gave me the most skeptical look ever.",

And his entire childhood he LITERALLY only ate French fries and pizza with the cheese scraped off. Oh and soda of course. This was from age 2 to now (he's 23). My mom enabled him at every turn, she would prepare a normal meal each night of veggies, starch and meat for the rest of the family, and a big plate of fries for him. When we go out to eat, she would tell the waiter in a fake \"half-jokey\" way \"Oh, he'll just have fries\" as if it's a one-time thing. He ended up developing into a gaunt ghostly looking adult (I literally believe he may have developed scurvy) who looks like the Sandy Hook shooter, with similar behavioral issues to boot. I don't speak to my family anymore.

Now I can comfortably order fast food and do so frequently and am somewhat overweight so I don't know what the moral of this post is. Also I don't know what your traffic situation or street setup is for a dual carriageway but it's usually easier for someone on the passenger side to get in/out of the car. Edit: Just to clarify, I am specifically responding to eggshitter on the frequency of parents sending their kids into the store to pick things up. The situation presented in ALLSTARTRIPOD's post is obviously just an example of a horrible person and I am not argueing for some kind of hidden good intentions they may or may not have or condoning their actions. (Though if I were the only possible arguement i could come up with is if they were rehearsing for some kind of play)",

I literally had to sit my (6'2\" 300 lbs) self on her chest, making sure not to use all my weight, and hold her hands down until she calmed down. She's better now btw. Not sure for how long.

The adult in that scenario is either lazy, or has issues of their own; but I wouldn't rush to judge cruel parenting.

Most people bike around, students and other people, both because of costs and because the roads here suck. It baffles me how fucking careless a lot of cyclists and some pedestrians behave. A lot of people walk on the roads. Yes, the sidewalks are absurdly small in some places and you can't have two people walking side by side, but the roads are equally small and there's not a lot of space for a car, a parked car *and* a pedestrian. And it still surprises me how people cross the road without looking. In the middle of the block, they just\u2026 cross it. On the diagonal, looking to the other side. What the hell? But the cyclists. I have never *almost* hit one, much less actually hit, but there are plenty situations that it would have happened were I two meters ahead. They have recent painted a bicycle lane in the biggest avenue around here (goes from the center of the town to the university - probably 2km between the two). Yet there are cyclists on the opposite side of the bicycle lane. And sometimes cyclists on *both* sides. And not rarely two cyclists on the same side, with one overtaking the other\u2026 by getting in my way *without even looking*. \"Oh, I'll just get into the 1-ton killing machines lane for some seconds, no need to make sure I won't end under one.\" There's also a lot of cyclists going against the direction of the road, so I'm looking at the incoming cars and entering the road and SURPRISE BICYCLE COMING FROM BEHIND A SUV ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. Also I've seen at least three occasions of cyclists just entering my lane from behind a truck or another obstacle that completely blocked their and mine views. Like, \"I'm sure the busiest road of this city will have no cars, so I'll just get in it.\" I seriously don't understand. I actually walk more than I drive because I live 5 minutes on foot from the university and I'm *really* careful, I always look to all sides, I always wait until there's no cars or a car stop for me to cross. I don't get how people can be stupid enough to put themselves in a situation where they depend on the awareness of others so they don't get killed.",

I was raised by *just* my mother and never had any strong relationship with extended family so I formed (probably an unhealthy) dependence on her and our relationship because she was basically all I had. Things weren't terrible *all* the time, either, and for every fucked up thing she did to me (physically and emotionally) there were times where she genuinely showed love for me and protected me from other people and stood up for me and that's always made me feel conflicted as fuck about her and my childhood. Added to that I know that her own childhood was abusive to a degree that was much more extreme than mine which isn't an excuse and doesn't make what she did to me right but her childhood damaged her in ways that I don't think she even realizes and shaped who she was as a person and a parent to a point that I can understand her and sympathize with her and I just find it hard to hate her because of that. As for our relationship, it actually improved a lot after she stopped being violent with me (which sounds fucked up, I know). Not like immediately but the lack of physical shit happening changed the entire atmosphere of our household and it eventually settled until our relationship was in a decent spot. I think growing up, becoming an adult, getting a job, and all of that just put us on more equal footing and she no longer treated me like a child who needed to be controlled and punished. Our relationship now is not 100% perfect but it's no longer abusive and most days it's good. I honestly can't imagine ever totally cutting my mother off because even throughout everything I do still love her. She's just a...really complex person with a lot of issues who made a lot of fuck ups. It's easier for me to forgive her for them and to build on to something better than to resent her. I've tried resentment and it's not healthy for me to hang on to, so I've let it go.",

She hasn't been my whole life, but she previously was already a stripper. I never got the explanation about how/why she made the evolution from first form to ultimate transformation, though... When i was a young kid she used to told me she was a \"dancer\". I never went to her workplaces, but more recently i've been able to know where they were, and i also now have very serious doubts about some of my then-babysitters, who probably were co-workers of my mother. Around me being eleven years old (i did got what kind of \"dance\" my mother was doing, at that time), she told me she has been asked to star in a movie, and she was thinking about accepting. I didn't thought much of it, at first. But i know that very quickly her work schedule changed, and she explained that was because she became a full-time actress. It took me about six months, something like that, to know a bit more about life. And i remember quite vividly the time i asked her. It was in the car, she was getting me back home after my swimming practice, and i asked her, totally out of the blue: \"that's porn movies, that you play in, right?\". She looked back at me through the inside mirror of the car, and i never saw her face like that. It was not exactly shame, but... I still don't know what it was. Perhaps it was a mix of relief and fear. It has been the only time i've seen this expression on her face. She nodded \"yes\" to me. Because of the expression, i knew it was like a \"decisive time\". So i just went full sincere and answered \"ok, cool. Can we eat at McDonald's?\". Sincerely, it would have been far worst even just a year later. At that moment, i still was a real kid, never masturbated or anything, and, well, that was my mom, she was taking care of me, by herself, for everything since my appearance in this world, and i was sincerely ok, with her job. If i had been a full on bratty teenager when i got the truth, i probably would have been more pissed than that. My mom is still \"professionally active\", today, and she's quite a forbidden topic with my friends. I never had to tell it, though. They just never try this angle, even when drunk or upset at me. I love them, and i love my mother. Even though it's really, really a turn off when i stumble upon her work while trying to find \"solo time visual support\". She has cancelled so much of my erections. **Edit**: thanks a lot for all the incredibly positive reactions, Reddit! I was fearing a lot of bad jokes and even more very negative judgements, but you provided quite the exact opposite! I've been adamant about being on my mom's side for all my life, and i never doubted of it, but sometimes it's just very sweet and heartwarming to see people \"get it\" :-) Just to answer the three points that have been brought on the most: 1) my username has actually been made especially for this thread, so it's normal it fits just right ;-) 2) No i will not tell you my mother work name, 3) Yes, i got that McDonald's! Thanks again, i will try to answer the last few questions, now!",

My mother was a Miss Nude World Champion, was a Penthouse Pet, and from what I hear, did some \"solo porn\" (Which was supposedly very softcore). I always knew. Well, at least as far back as I could know I suppose. When I was a kid, I always met my mom's friends, and quickly knew their titles as well (Oh she's Miss such and such of So and So magazine). The rest of the family knew too, and they hated it. We've always been somewhat separate from them because of it. The problem was never me knowing so much, as OTHER kids finding out. I learned early not to tell ANYONE. Every few years word would get around on the playground, and fist-fights would start. It wasn't until high-school though, that some of the other students were 18 and could go to the strip club my mother worked at. More fights. All in all, it made me pretty fucked up. My standards for what women should look like are incredibly high. I was told my entire life, while seeing pictures of my mom's friends naked, \"This isn't sexual\". That fucked me up. I get practically no arousal from seeing a woman naked. I don't trust other men. I think they're/we're all motivated by sex, or at least that's how I've seen it my whole life. This makes me a very jealous boyfriend. I once did a photoshoot with Janine Lindemoulder. That's the chick from the cover of the Blink 182 album dressed as a nurse. She did hardcore porn and was popular around the same era my mom was. During the shoot, she asked me how my mom told me... I told her, and asked if she'd told her kids, to which she responded \"No, they found out though when one of them saw one of my videos at a friends house\". Always thought about that, and how glad I was to have always known what my mother did. Much better than stumbling into it the other way. Anyway that's my experience! Edit1: Looks like I got the year wrong, and accidentally Doxxed a known pornstar... so there's that. Edited to remove incorrect data. Edit2: I see they've harvested my words for an article! My fault for making it all seem negative. It wasn't. I traveled America, I got a good education, never been arrested, no drug addictions, never molested, and kids from much more \"normal\" backgrounds can't even claim all that sometimes! I can't complain, but the context of the question merited the response that I wrote. ",

I will say that being around that environment started me being sexual at an early age. Once I was older I kinda used it to brag to my friends. It was a secret that only my close friends knew, but one that I didn't feel the need to be embarrassed by. She was called the \"hot mom\". It kinda just became a norm.

It kinda fucked with me for a while because I was very conservative about sex (grandparents raised me) and I was judgmental in my mind, but never to my mom. Now that I'm older I'm way more accepting of it, especially when a couple years ago I was struggling to make rent fresh out of high school and was deeply considering sex work. I did sell a few pairs of used panties and uh, went on a couple... *dates*, to make some extra cash for rent, but never had PIV for money. Desperation is a hell of a motivator. ",

She liked the money but I know that the industry seriously depressed her and she felt a lot of shame. She had a really fucked up childhood and did everything she could to protect her kids from having a life like she had. The funny side of it is that she may have met my brother's father in the industry because I found a Playgirl with him on the cover. I think she did a lesser magazine or too as well but thankfully both were more loin cloth type gigs and no full nudity to really fuck my eyes up forever. I honestly think that her becoming super religious affected my social life more than anything. I wasn't allowed to officially date until I was 18 and I felt a lot of the usual shame connected to sexuality that religion can bring. ",

Mortified she closed the browser and immediately called her mother for an explanation. Long story short her ex scumbag stepfather forced her mother to do a few pornos because he said they were strapped for money and it was an emergency. She only did it a couple times and then she left him so she never did it again. My friend was bawling her eyes out for hours. Nothing I said or did made it any better. She completely stopped watching porn all together and lost a lot of her libido for a good chunk of time which was sad because she was ravenous in the bedroom. She got over it eventually and forgave her mother instantly because she totally understood why her mom would do it. Her mother is an absolute angel and loves me just as much as the other 4 girls she has and it never changed my opinion of her. Sex work is a fact of life for some women and even I have been paid for activities of a sexual nature when the time called for it. I love my friend and her regardless of who or how they fuck. ",

I didn't think it was that big of a deal until I met her, and she was in fact very stereotypical in her looks and dress. No wonder he didn't want her at our school events. That all being said, she seemed to love him and tried to be a part of his life which he didn't really want at the time. He seems to be ok now, has dabbled with drugs and being a crusty punk kid hopping trains and such but based on FB it looks like he found a girl and settled down a little in the last couple years.

I was never exploited in any way, but he would buy me thousands of dollars of clothing if my mother took (always clean) photographs of me wearing them. He bought me a $2000 Ariana papel designer grade 8 graduation dress and a $7000 Old Navy order in which I asked for most of the store, and received. My mother was also a fan of foursquare and checking into her location constantly, so every so often creepy guys would follow us and take pictures.

This was a couple years before we'd met around 2000. No face shots...not that he wasn't worthy mind you, but the bit was about HER - he provided the, umm \"meat\" in a couple of the close up photos. And yep...It was him! He said it was absolutely exhausting physically to have to contort into uncomfortable poses and try not to move (or fall!) while she balanced on the edge of this tiny shelf thing...Also in an impossible position while they shot the photos. Not a turn on to actually do by any stretch of the imagination, however the spread very much came out as such in my opinion!! The (apparently rather famous?) photographer and his wife/girlfriend invited them both out on the town with them in NYC, but he declined. He wasn't a drinker or into any drugs (except weed) and had recently found out his gf had a rather large fondness for cocaine which he wasn't very happy about so she agreed when he said no thanks. He said he also suspected they had more on their minds besides just painting the town red and that creeped them both out. He also accompanied her to one of the Hedonism resorts in Jamaica for some adult industry convention, a week all expenses paid. The STORIES!!! He said it wasn't something he'd ever do again but also something he would never have even been able to imagine putting on his \"bucket list\" but he was damn glad to have had the experience before he died!! (Edit: took out the \"&\" symbol between \"unfortunately\" and \"recently deceased\"... unfortunate that he's recently deceased, not that he was my husband!) He's been gone since October but he made sure to hide a couple of issues for me to find as a rather unconventional but much treasured memento of him! (Edit #2: As far as I know, our kids from our previous marriages don't know, and our one child we had together is only 10 and has autism...I hope to God he doesn't know!!) ",

I'd known since we were fairly young and never saw it as a big deal. She's a fantastic mother and raised two boys on her own. When we were about 12 some of the boys at school found out and managed to get pictures of her. They would throw pages at my friend and, on at least one occasion, the pages were 'sticky'. He got in a hell of a lot of fights over it and it was basically the catalyst for the two of us starting to skip school and hanging round my estate all day getting in trouble with the older kids. His Mams job meant that she could provide a good life for her sons. They lived in a rich area of town, had a big house and she was actively interested in her children's life. But thinking back I cringe at some of the things the boys at school would say and do. We've lost touch but, as a teenager, he struggled with relationships with women who weren't me and had major trust issues. He had two kids with two different girls before we were twenty. It's interesting you mention about the way you now see women's bodies. I used to get changed in front of him all the time and he never blinked an eye. When I stated 'developing' I actually went and had a chat with his Mam about it rather than my own and went bra shopping with her. None of it ever seemed to phase him even though he is definitely straight. Most of my boyfriends as a teenager were completely jealous of him and thought that something had to be going on as we were pretty much inseparable but it was never anything more than a friendship.

Usually they would say \"thank you, I'm glad to hear it,\" sign whatever they were asked to sign, maybe take a photo, and move on. However, what was most interesting was to see them interacting with their social group (I was on the fringes of it and some of my friends knew some of their friends). It was obvious who was *really* nice and who was not. I also found out which of them is almost always drunk, which is a bitch, which is really quiet and shy despite her online persona, and which is exactly like she is in her videos.",

Playboy Magazine was like Vice before it became a common thing to explore taboo topics. Playboy was like National Geographic for adults. Penthouse, Juggs, Hustler was just pure nude fantasy. I admire Hef for attracting attention to social and political topics enticing with a few pages of nude women. Its a shame how the magazine world has all devolved into just TnA. Not to mention free pornography videos via the internet. I think it is safe to say all magazines are going the way of the Dodo. They can't keep up with the rapid influx of media. Not many still read the newspapers much less wait for a nudey magazine to come out each week. Damn I sound old for a late 20's man. ",

But i know my approach to sex is far more casual than most. Like, i see absolutely no problem to have sex on the first date, or anywhere, or to talk about it openly... I've learned the hard way that sex is something i talk about too easily, sometimes with people i clearly not know enough for that. Also, i never had a sexual situation that i would feel nervous about. I think i skipped the part of life where sex \"scares you\", and i'm not yet 100% sure it's totally a good thing. I don't know.

Shortly after the paperback, a hardback version was released that included a special edition of 200 signed and numbered copies bound in asbestos. These were technically collections because the novel was published with two short stories: The Playground and And the Rock Cried Out, which have been absent in later printings. A few months later, the novel was serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of nascent Playboy magazine.",

Sean Spicer will become the Ron Ziegler of this era. Both were/are paranoid schizophrenic persons who think of themselves as above the law. Nixon knew the law (was a lawyer) and chose to violate due to his paranoia. Trump just does not care or think about legality or ethics, things he has never needed to be concerned with. Both tried to get the FBI to do their bidding (Trump just asked the FBI to hold off on Russia investigations). Nixon did know how to govern, how to set up and run a presidential administration, Trump does not have a clue. Nixon probably paid attention to intelligence briefings. As others have mentioned Nixon signed into law the creation of the EPA. I expect Trump will not be known for any such forward thinking legislation. (I was in high school when this went down. My mother was a college government professor so we were paying attention in my household).",

Hopefully I live long enough for that to revert. Edit: Sigh... I was really hoping this wouldn't turn into a partisan argument, but I guess I need to point out that I don't like lying *in general,* not just when it's a Republican. Bill Clinton's \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinski\" lie pissed me off quite a bit.

Multiple others were hit, too - a police officer shot in the neck, and the press secretary (James Brady) who was struck in the head. Brady was permanently disabled by the attack, and became a campaigner for gun control. One of the better known pieces of gun control legislation in the US in recent history (colloquially called \"the Brady Bill\"), places restrictions on the sale of firearms to felons, people diagnosed as mentally unstable, and those with a history of violence. To my knowledge, Reagan is the only president to have actually been shot while in office and survived (four have been killed by gunfire), though a number of others have had shots fired at them which missed (in some cases others were killed or wounded), GW Bush had a live grenade thrown at him (which failed to detonate), and Teddy Roosevelt was shot in the chest while giving a speech, but that was after he was out of office, and he was campaigning to be re-elected.

He was voted into office in '92 to deliver a prosperous economy and he was doing exactly what he was mandated to do. 71% of people thought he was a successful president in '98. That number grew to an astronomical 81% one year later in '99. Trump's victory despite the pussy-grabbing video should have taught us all something.

It was less than two years after the official end of the war that North Vietnam reinvaded the South. It was that reinvasion (combined with America's betrayal of the South) that led to the ultimate capture of South Vietnam by the communists.

He didn't really come from a politically connected or rich family and lets face it he wasn't handsome and doesn't seem particularly charming or likeable. His life and political career was a series of set backs where he seemed to succeed by sheer stubbornness and creating workarounds to move forward. I'd encourage reading his early life section at least. Despite his actions, after reading his early life section I couldn't help but kind of like the guy and sometimes even pity him even though many of the policy decisions he made were abhorrent. I suppose the article is maintained by people who like Nixon even still so its probably kind of bias though. I genuinely believe he was devoted and loved his wife and family dearly though, doesn't change whether he was a good president but it makes it hard for me to see him as a monster.",

The ones that have nearly gotten me into accidents so far are: \u2022Being cut off from the inner lane on one particular roundabout - has happened on both the entrances and exits, and it's always soccer mums in cars too big for them. \u2022Dark cars suddenly not being able to find the switch for their headlights at dusk and during rain. \u2022Tailgating. Just don't be an asshat driver, I can guarantee it will end poorly for your insurance premium and paint job.",

After following the car very slowly for while the car stops once more in the traffic. My uncle sits there and waits for about 20 minutes. The car still hasn't moved. All he can see is the headlights in front of him. Eventually he gets out to see whats the matter. When my uncle gets out and walks to the car in front of him he see's the entire front of the car completely totaled. Inside was the dead driver. The back part of the car was completely fine and my uncle did not even know a thing was wrong earlier due to the fog. The story always unsettled me when i had to drive in fog...",

Not to mention it's in the country, so there are country folks. Of course that's fine but they tend to drive slower (which I should probably do too). Sometimes you'll get stuck behind a semi passing another. The tailgaters seem to thing I can somehow move them out of the way. One time this guy in a tricked out BMW gets sick of tailgating me and tries passing on the right. He can't of course because the road is jammed. But as he gets even with me he flicks me off. I'm thinking why are you pissed at *me* alone? Does he think I'm somehow responsible for all the cars jamming the road?

Not surprised in the least that this is happening.

Safety first is paramount for you since you're still learning. Adamantly going exactly the speed limit in the left lane is like being \"that guy\" who loves to be difficult and argue by starting every other sentence with \"Well, *technically*...\" Don't worry about the so-called road etiquette (or lack thereof) for now.

A car starts tailgating him, with two older folks in it. They beep their horn. He's a nice guy, generally, so he pulls over a bit so they can pass him. They don't. He pulls back into the lane and continues at speed. They tailgate again and beep at him. Mildly frustrated, he drifts out of the lane so they can pass. They don't. Instead, they continue to tailgate and beep at him. Finally, infuriated (Dad had a short fuse), he pulls way over, slows way down, puts down the window, and waves them around. They finally pass him; both heads turn to look at him; they smile and wave. Dad gives them the raised middle finger with a look of loathing and anger, shouting, \"Fuck you!\" at them. He continues home. When he gets home, he parks, steps out of the car and heads for the front door. As he passes the rear of the car, he notices the bumper sticker on the back bumper: \"Honk if you love Jesus!\" His VP was a devote Jesus lover. Dad, not so much.",

If fog lights are bothering you, they are probably aftermarket or improperly set up, in which case those owners need to fix them or not run them on public roads. Benefits: Greater visibility in area right in front of car and greater visibility for other cars to see you (4 lights). Downsides: Wears out the bulb slightly faster Do you yell at people who run their headlights during the day? Daytime running lights are required in Canada for example. It helps improve visibility of the car.",

The teeth of the head grazed against his leg as he rode, causing a fatal infection. * 1567: Hans Steininger, the burgomaster of Braunau (then Bavaria, now Austria), died when he broke his neck by tripping over his own beard. * 1871: Clement Vallandigham, a lawyer and Ohio, U.S., politician defending a man on a charge of murder, accidentally shot himself demonstrating how the victim might have shot himself while in the process of drawing a weapon when standing from a kneeling position. Though the defendant, Thomas McGehan, was ultimately cleared, Vallandigham died from his wound. * 1993: Garry Hoy, a 38-year-old lawyer in Toronto, Canada, fell to his death on 9 July 1993 after he threw himself against a window on the 24th floor of the Toronto-Dominion Centre in an attempt to prove to a group of visitors that the glass was \"unbreakable\", a demonstration he had done many times before. The glass did not break, but popped out of the window frame, and Hoy fell to his death. * 2011: Fagilyu Mukhametzyanov, 49, had been wrongly declared dead after suffering a heart attack when she woke up in a coffin at her own funeral in Kazan, Russia. As she saw and heard the mourning relatives she started screaming and suffered yet another heart attack, this time fatal. * 2013: Miguel Martinez, 14, from Lubbock, Texas, was impaled through the chest by the horn of a bull statue.

The explosions constituted what was then the loudest human-made sound in history, and could be heard in London. The largest single charge was the Lochnagar mine south of La Boisselle with 60,000 lb (27 t) of ammonal explosive. The mine created a crater 300 ft (90 m) across and 90 ft (30 m) deep, with a lip 15 ft (5 m) high. The crater is known as Lochnagar Crater after the trench from where the main tunnel was started. On 3 July 1969, an N1 rocket in the Soviet Union exploded on the launch pad, after a turbopump exploded in one of the engines. The entire rocket contained about 680,000 kg (680 t) of kerosene and 1,780,000 kg (1,780 t) of liquid oxygen.[43] Using a standard energy release of 43 MJ/kg of kerosene gives about 29 TJ for the energy of the explosion (about 6.93 kt TNT equivalent). Investigators later determined that up to 85% of the fuel in the rocket did not detonate, meaning that the blast yield was likely no more than 1kt TNT equivalent.[44] **soviet engineering best engineering** ",

Background from the article: > The\u00a0G\u00e4vle Goat\u00a0(Swedish:\u00a0G\u00e4vlebocken) is a traditional Christmas display erected annually at Slottstorget (Castle Square) in central\u00a0G\u00e4vle, Sweden. It is a giant version of a traditional\u00a0Swedish\u00a0Yule Goat\u00a0figure made of\u00a0straw. It is erected each year at the beginning of\u00a0Advent\u00a0over a period of two days by local community groups, and has become famous for being destroyed in arson attacks during December. Despite security measures and the nearby presence of a fire station, the goat has been burned to the ground most years since its first appearance in 1966. As of December 2016, the goat has been damaged 37 times. Seriously though, if you want to laugh, click the link and read the \"timeline\" section. It's fucking gold. Some highlights: > 1998: Burned down during a major\u00a0blizzard > 2005: Burnt by unknown vandals reportedly dressed as Santa and the\u00a0gingerbread man, by shooting a flaming arrow at the goat > 2009: On the night of 23 December before 04:00 the South Merchant goat was set on fire and was burned to the frame, even though it had a thick layer of snow on its back.\u00a0The goat had two online webcams which were put out of service by a\u00a0DoS attack, instigated by computer hackers just before the burning. > 2016: Destroyed by an arsonist equipped with petrol on its inauguration day, just hours after its 50th \"birthday party\". Organizers said they would not rebuild the goat this year. It was replaced by a smaller \"replica\" built by local high school students. This goat was later hit by a car.",
