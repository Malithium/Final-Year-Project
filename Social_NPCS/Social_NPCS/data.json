Regrip shaft at base beyond balls, squeeze and work towards tip, little shake\n\n**I just went pee and I realized that when I say 'regrip' on step 2 I do not mean switch hand positions. When you are done peeing you should use one hand (left hand for me) to do step 1, while your other is holding your shaft in a stationary position. Then once you are done with step 1, your hand that was holding your shaft stationary (right hand for me) 'regrips' the shaft at the base and performs step 2.",

I go down to the basment and retrive the christmas lights. I have a plan. I have the answer.\n\nShe flies into our dark bedroom when a twinkle comes from our bed.

They're wrapped around my cock. She lands on the shaft. \"*UGGHHHHH*,\" I moan, as she flutters her soft wings on the tip of my penis. Its perfect.

It'd be like an homage to Cronenberg with references to earlier stuff so you don't come off too fanboyish, ya know? And then the last scene of the short is of the moth in a sealed jar sitting on the mantle above the fireplace in the man's living room with the man pacing back and forth in front of it. It cuts to a closeup of the jar where we see the moth still fluttering lightly, weakly, in vain against the glass. Flames lap the curves of the jar as it reflects the firelight. Cut to black and you can only assume the guy killed himself. ",

I have a part time job at Wal-mart, and also a full-time student at Uni. I'm studying x degree with a minor in y because job prospects.\" And then you weigh in the obvious. There will be no consummation, and conversation will have to take place on a keyboard because I'm not sure if said moth can also text.

Wouldnt recommend. Browns have pretty decent resistance already.\n\n**Black**: The same as reds just with more resistance. I personally do not recommend these.\n\n**Reds**: Good for high speed stuff such as osu! or hyper speed writers. Be warned, these do not give you haptic feedback like blue and brown ~~and black~~ so errors are program.\n\n**Silent**: If you cant stand the mechanical noise for some reason or your mic is trash, buy these. Pretty much Reds in super silent.\n\n**Blues**: Great for journalists and linux core developers thanks to their great audible feedback. The hook? Be prepared to never speak to a human being over voice chat anymore.\n\n**Greens**: No.\n\nAs this comment blew up more than expected, if you're interested in mechanical keyboards, definitly check /r/MechanicalKeyboards and do some research yourself to see what switches you prefer.\n\n**How much is a mech keyboard?**\n\n120$ - 180$ is a good estimate, depending on your demand for features.\n\n**But why should I spend 120$ if I could buy a keyboard for 15$ every year?**\n\nTyping on a mechanical keyboard is magical. You **will** refuse to type on a rubberdome (generic keyboard) if you have the choice, once you typed on a mechanical keyboard. Rubberdomes on average have a guarantee for being stable in the first five figure keystrokes. After that, they will degrade faster and faster until a keyboard becomes *unusable* to a vanilla user. Mechanical switches are guaranteed to be 100% the same for a few million keystrokes.\n\nMy advice? Buy a proper mechanical keyboard, do your hands a favor and laugh at your friends as they will buy multiple trash keyboards over the years. ",

Not that that extreme scenario would happen with every guy she rejects, but it only needs to happen once for it to affect her life. \n\nOne thing most women experience (frequently, this is not rare at all) is an exchange like this, esp online: \"Hey, beautiful.\" \"Oh, hi.\" \"Hey, wanna go out sometime?\" \"Sorry, I have a boyfriend now.\" \"You think you're better than me, you stupid bitch??? You're not that hot anyway. I'm not gonna bang a 4 like you when I'm scoring 8s and 9s practically in my sleep. HAVE FUN BEING A CUNT.\" \n\nWe have learned to soften the blow and are afraid of being too direct because that violent outburst would be 3000x worse in person than online. These conversations usually start off reasonably nice, and you never know who the violent guy is going to be (they blend in with other guys, Agent in the Matrix-style), so we have to be cautious.",

However, when he asks me out and I decline, he cuts off all interaction and moves on to the next girl. Do you realize how dehumanizing that is; to realize that you're only viewed as an objective? You're basically saying, \"if I can't have you the way I want you, then you aren't worth keeping around.\" \n\nI don't feel the need to reassert my right to say no, because, while that is something nice guys don't always recognize, is not the point I'm trying to make. Rather, I'm trying to state that you should stop viewing girls as endgames. We have value outside of being romantic partners, but it feels like you don't recognize that or care when you only pursue us as such. \n\nEdit: There seems to be confusion as to who I am referring to in my original comment. I am speaking solely of \"nice guys,\" or men who befriend women solely with the intention of sleeping/establishing a relationship with her. I can certainly understand situations where, if two people have been friends for a long time and romantic feelings start to develop in one of the parties, that said individual creates some distance. It is incredibly difficult to continue any kind of relationship with someone you know deeply and have developed serious feelings for. With that being said, this situation is nearly impossible in the circumstances I mainly had in mind when typing my original comment; where a man meets a girl, is sexually attracted to her, and therefore pretends to befriend her so as to increase his chances of getting with her. When she says no, he ghosts her. Quite frankly, it's not even the silence that bothers me; it's being viewed as a notch in someone's belt. I am certainly not a perfect person, but I'd like to think I am worth befriending. When men do this, it sends the message that my value is solely linked to how I can appease him, and that I'm really not good enough to be their friend. It's hurtful. I hope that clarifies what I was saying. ",

                    "body": "[No More Mr. Nice Guy](http://divalion.livejournal.com/163615.html)\n\nThere are the guys who identify as \"nice guys\", often quite loudly and defensively, and who believe themselves to be underappreciated martyrs; usually they don't understand why they never get the girl and have at least once in their lives bitterly uttered the phrase \"Nice guys finish last\" usually in reference to a female who isn't dating them.\n\nThere are a lot of Nice Guys out there, and they are incredibly insidious, because on the surface they SEEM so sweet, so misunderstood, so very different from the boorish asshole who cheated on you or told you that those pants do, indeed, make your ass look fat. But in the end, they turn out to be using their \"niceness\" as an excuse to hide behind, much like medieval aristocracy used cloying perfumes to cover up the ass-stank of their unwashed bodies.\n\nI have some news for you, Nice Guys of the world. \"Nice\" isn't as much of a selling point as you'd think. In fact, for most women, it's like expecting that your new car will come with wheels attached. I know that you think bitcheswomen only like bad boys and jerkoffs, but we'll get to that.\n\nThe guys I have met and known who could legitimately be called Nice Guys were, for one thing, almost invariably bitter. Either they have never gotten over being picked on in junior high/rejected by the popular girls in school, or they haven't gotten laid in a long time, or they've gotten dumped sometime in the last few years and are still licking their wounds. Whatever it is, they have a huge chip on their shoulders about it, and in their eyes the women of the world owe them for it. They don't usually verbalize it, but oh how the resentment seethes.\n\nThey tend to befriend women in order to date them. Nice Guys don't usually just ask a woman out and at least make a pretext of friendship to use as a springboard. This is where they can get confused with actual nice guys, who tend to also befriend women before dating them, but the difference is that the genuine nice guy appreciates women as human beings and enters into friendships mostly for their own sake rather than working them as an angle. The Nice Guy, on the other hand, sees women mostly in sexual terms (although he will deny it or call it \"romantic terms\") but doesn't have a lot of success with the direct approach, so instead he puts on a charming, harmless face in order to befriend women with the expectation that she will reward his niceness and friendship with sex. It can be a subtle difference, but there are clues-- the Nice Guy tends to come on pretty strong as a friend, and often makes \"joking\" sexual comments that can be dismissed as not intended seriously if the woman doesn't respond to the come-on implied in it. He will hang his belief that you would make great friends on the smallest of compatibilities-- for example a shared interest in a band, which he makes an awful lot of hay out of. He may talk a lot about how victimized he's been by cruel ex-girlfriends in a ploy for sympathy.\n\nOne of the more glaring things a Nice Guy will do is to listen sympathetically if you are complaining about problems in your relationship and then talk enthusiastically about what a jerk that guy is and how HE would never do such a thing. Sometimes it's an even more overt \"hey, if you dump him, you could always start fucking me\". This is because a Nice Guy does not seem to get that women confiding their relationship problems to a friend are not looking for the replacement model, and they see this as their chance to show how sympathetic and NICE and attentive they are and to score points off of your vulnerability. Also, the only thing a Nice Guy hates and resents more than a woman who doesn't return his interest is a man who is actually involved with a woman. It's some kind of fucked up alpha wolf pissing contest but he would just love to lure a woman away from her boyfriend (who he perceives as more alpha because he has a female) and thus prove that the nice identity he's invested so much in is really the bigger-dicked one. And Nice Guys are wholly convinced that they themselves are too NICE to ever do anything wrong, and they genuinely think that they would be a perfect partner, whereas the guy who's with a woman must be having problems because he's an asshole, not because people in relationships have problems sometimes. The Nice Guy thinks he is a white knight who will never fuck up if only a woman would give him a chance. He's wrong, of course, because we all fuck up with our partners, but the Nice Guy also doesn't like to own up to his fuckups and when he gets dumped, tells everyone that he was \"too nice\" and the girl couldn't handle it.\n\nNice Guys think it is enough for them to be so nice, so sweet, so attentive. Because it is enough, they think it's ok to let other stuff slide. Like it doesn't matter if they have good hygiene, because a girl who cares so much about exteriors is shallow and hypocritical if she can't see past a layer of funk to the shining prince beneath. They don't think it's important to develop much in the way of social skills or good manners (although some of them do have a certain amount of charisma). They never stop to ask themselves whether the fact that they haven't dated anyone since 1997 might have something to do with their annoying behaviors or poor sense of humor. In fact, they see no reason to make any extra effort to improve themselves or present themselves well at all-- because they're SO VERY NICE.\n\nConversely, though, most Nice Guys only fall for a fairly limited range of \"hot\" chicks. It's because women are all about the status for them, and they are out to prove something to the world. Some of them will deliberately only go after women who are fairly unattainable, if their martyr complex needs some care and feeding.\n\nNice Guys usually are crap at reading body language and nonverbal cues and usually have serious personal space problems. Women get creeped out because they feel like the guy is literally clinging to them, or is coming on really strong really fast, or doesn't seem to pick up on the fact that they're tensing up or moving away. But since the Nice Guy *knows* he has good intentions, he is deeply insulted by the suggestion that his behavior is unwelcome, creepy, or even threatening. (Whereas a genuine nice guy who misreads a situation is horrified that he might have come across that way and apologizes for it.)\n\nNice Guys don't actually care what a woman wants, which is one of the keys to identifying a Nice Guy vs. a nice guy, and which runs directly counter to their most deeply held beliefs about themselves. They think that they are great, caring, compassionate partners; usually, they just want a captive audience. They don't have much respect for what her desires and preferences are unless they are for him, because if she wants something different than him, it is attributed to her dysfunction and desire to be treated badly by an asshole. They may spend some time with pick-up books and things that tell them how to get chicks, but they tend to follow the letter of the law and not the spirit. That's why he'll serenade you on a subway platform even though he knows you don't like to call attention to yourself, and then be hurt that you were uncomfortable and embarrassed by the display. He likes to make a big show out of being romantic and considerate, especially when others are watching, but he will still forget to pick up his socks even if you've told him you'd rather have a clean floor than roses delivered to your office.\n\nBut the real foolproof way to identify a Nice Guy is to watch how he treats a woman who turns him down romantically. A true-blue Nice Guy invariably will unleash the scorn and contempt and resentment that's been seething under the surface all along, and excoriate the woman he claimed to care about. One of the favored maneuvers is to retreat behind sarcasm, claim that whatever she found unwelcome was \"just a joke\", and defensively inform her that she has no sense of humor, that she's taking everything way too seriously. Once in a while he'll try to keep being friends-- especially if he thinks there's another chance in it for him-- but he'll let fly with the snarky comments about her, the passive-aggressive \"humor\" that always points back to her rejection of him, and especially so if she shows interest in anyone else. He's just waiting for that romance to fail so that he can say, \"see, she rejects ME when I would've treated her right, but runs after that asshole instead, and now she got hurt. I could've told her that would happen!\" And you will never hear a Nice Guy say anything gracious about a guy who dates a woman who rejected him.\n\nThe most insidious part of it is the way that Nice Guys turn everything back on the girl, make it all her fault. If she doesn't want to date him-- poor, poor him! What sort of shallow bitch must she be to want a relationship but not with him? Coincidentally, this tactic can sometimes score him a sympathy fuck if he's got a backup girl to run to.\n\nThe absolute key difference between a nice guy and a Nice Guy is that the nice guy truly likes and respects women and doesn't feel entitled to the attentions of any woman. The Nice Guy pretends to be that, but secretly he has decided that all women suck (usually for the sins of a couple of them), and he doesn't really care about anything so much as propping up his limp ego.",

                    "body": "That being \"nice\" isn't enough.  What women are looking for is a good boyfriend, not some generic nicerton.\n\nI've dated plenty of guys who the world at large deems \"nice.\"  They're polite, non-confrontational, pleasant.  A big problem is, they're too busy being \"nice\" to bother being a good boyfriend.  They don't want to stand up for me if I need them to, because then that would be \"impolite.\"  I asked the guy I was dating to avoid a man I dislike immensely for very good reasons (which my boyfriend knew) when we were at a function none of us could get out of.  So of course, my boyfriend, The Nice Guy, did absolutely nothing as this guy got into my space, engaged me while I actively tried to leave the conversation, and smiled politely.  Of wait, did I say nothing?  I meant \"made jovial small talk with.\"  He was much more concerned with not appearing slightly rude or standoffish in front of people he didn't even know than he was with how I felt or what I needed.  \n\nBeing non-confrontational also doesn't mean you're kind or a good boyfriend.  It usually means you're either a doormat or a liar.  If these Nice Guy exes disagreed with me or didn't want to do what I wanted to do, the reaction wasn't \"no, because reasons\" or \"let's do something else.\"  It was either to roll over and agree with me, while silently seething and stewing and resenting me while I was oblivious, or to pretend to roll over and agree with me, then do/say the exact opposite when my back was turned.  They were not concerned with their own needs, and never considered that compromise or debate was possible, and certainly didn't give a fuck about how lying to me or resenting me secretly would make me feel.  They just wanted to avoid the momentary discomfort of me thinking they weren't being \"nice.\"  \n\nThe thing is, they had very little to offer other than being \"nice.\"  Once the veneer washed off and I realized that they had no interest in being loving and supportive to *me*, but just wanted to maintain the image of \"not being a mean dude\" to everyone forever, there was nothing there.  They had been skating through life on doors held open, smiles, and avoided arguments for their whole lives, and never bothered to develop any other valuable traits because they'd been getting headpats for being \"nice\" for decades.  Eventually, it no longer is worth it to give a guy a chance just because he's moderately pleasant.  \n\nAnd that's from the point of view of having *dated* these guys, and only done so after getting to know them ok, and confirming that they were, in fact, pretty nice dudes.  If I don't know you well, \"nice\" is an informed ability.  I have no evidence to confirm some dude I just met is nice.  A lot of guys are like \"if you gave me the chance, I *would,* I *could*.\"  But....you're not *doing*, you're talking about what you *might* do in the future under the assumption that you get a reward in advance.  First off, human emotions are not a reward.  Second, saying \"I would, I will, I can\" doesn't mean anything, only what you actually do has value.  If you give me a million dollars today, I *could* march down the street naked singing showtunes tomorrow.  I certainly *could*.  That doesn't mean that you'd be making a wise investment to give me a million dollars now in anticipation I won't take the check and flee into the night.\n\nFinally, the way \"nice guys\" talk about other men is creepy, hateful, and weird.  Every guy who isn't as passive and avoidant as them is labeled a douche, a creep, an asshole, a \"Chad,\" whatever.  Most of those guys are just more confident and assertive than you, and less preoccupied with maintaining a non-confrontational image at all costs, even if it hurts you and those you claim to love.  A lot of them are nicer than the \"nice guys\" too.",

Where You Looking?**  \n\n\nI hope this rant isn't too long. I have a strong passion about this subject because I was this guy. BTW broad topic, so there is going to be generalizations.   \n1. What else you got?  \nCool you're nice, you listen, you are there for her. What else you got? Are you driven? Are you responsible? Are you hygienic? Are you fun? Do you have dreams for your own life?  \nBeing nice is great when being friends (shut up about friendzone, we'll get there). Why else would your \"crush\" want to date you? Do you share interests? Can you inspire her or be inspired by her? Can you show that you know how to handle day to day responsibilities? Dating someone is not just serving someone, being the shoulder to cry on, sacrificing everything to meet their needs. It's about taking a journey together, experiencing things. Being nice is good, but it's a start.   \nI was nice, but I was also a slob. I didn't take care of myself, my clothes, my car, but I expected all that to be overlooked because I was nice.  I would bemoan that I was not dating material because I wasn't Clooney or Pitt. Not true. I was not dating material because I didn't bring anything else besides being nice AND because I was a hypocrite...  \n2. Hypocrite Much  \nI would wail and complain about girls being shallow and not looking past my appearance. My crushes were females that would interact with me....but were also cute.  I would expect them to overlook my physical appearance, BUT only pursue women who I deemed attractive. Yes, it's stupid, but I think it's a common double standard.   \n3. Where you looking?  \nAnother mistake I made early on. I would go with my friends to clubs and parties and try to hit on girls....just like they did. I am  not going to find someone on physical interactions alone. I build friendships. Look at what you do, outside of obsessing, figure that out and expand on it. From there find communities that share your interests and socialize, make friends, stop looking for the gorgeous quirky girl that Hollywood promises (lies to) you. You want them to look past your awkward, fugly(this references me) exterior.....you look past your physical standards. It's not about \"settling\". If you are playing the Nice guy card, then it's about relationships and not one night stands. Looks change, people get old, but finding someone who you can have conversations with, people to share your dreams is probably more important.  \nI have to run, but if there is interest I can continue on things I have learned like **Taking the Risk/Non-Risk**",

Was told by multiple girls growing up I was the 2nd hottest guy in my neighborhood. Always got the drunk girl at the party \"You're Hot!\" or \"What's your name?\" etc.. Hooking up with girls was no problem for me at college bars / college life. However, getting a girlfriend which is what I really wanted was really difficult. The problem was that I think I was just so nice people saw it as weak. Hey, can you help me with this? \"sure\" Can you drive me here? \"no, problem\". I would never say no for someone asking me to help them with something. It comes off as weak. Women do not like weak men. It was the way I carried myself that women did not find me dating material. You can be nice but don't be overly nice! Say no and assert yourself more often even if it doesn't feel natural.\n",

He is a man who hasn't committed any crimes (he told me a story how a girl passed out next to him, and how she was \"so lucky\" to pass out next to such a good guy who _didn't_ rape her. Then he likes to tell this heroic story to people and expect praises how incredibly well he did, what an exceptionally lucky lady she truly was, indeed), goes to school, knows how to shower and who doesn't drink or use drugs numerous times a week. These are not the qualities that makes someone a good person or a good man, these are qualities that make you a _normal_ person. \n\n\nIf the bar you are setting yourself is that if you can function like an normally developed adult should behave, like making your own money, taking care of your hygiene, following the normal social rules like not being rude to others and obeying the law, means you expect women to be impressed of grateful for that, you need to either date someone who isn't able to accomplish those themselves and finds those qualities impressive or then understand the other person is doing the exact same thing.\n\n\n\nI really don't understand where this kind of attitude comes from.

It's inherently harder to be friends with the opposite sex. \n\nFor the second thing, just to elaborate a bit, friendship - to me - means being in a platonic relationship that is totally comfortable. When you're around friends you can relax. But when you're around someone you're attracted to? There's sexual tension. You can try and bury those feelings, but that tension is going to constantly be clashing with the idea of letting your guard down and being comfortable. And if it's someone you actually asked out and were turned down by? Now awkwardness and embarrassment is thrown into the mix. Some guys can still be easygoing in this situation, but I'm willing to bet it's a very, very small percentage. \n\nIt's easier to just avoid the whole thing. Friendship is something that should be a comfort zone, and it's just not worth it trying to make that happen with someone who turned you down when you can avoid the drama and the sexual tension entirely. In general, I think that's the main reason why girls have a hard time finding platonic guy friends. ",

But she's struggling with depression and i can only do so much.\n\nBut she's had this friend for almost 2 years now, maybe her best friend, other than me while we were dating. He has always had a major crush on her, and she turned him down before we met. The problem is how he acted after the first turn down. He completely ignored her for 5 days and would send her messages saying he might do something stupid than disappear for the day. That got sorted out and they remained friends, but i knew he still had a thing for her.\n\n It got to the point where he never hung out with her when i was around because i was dating her, i even kept all PDA behind closed doors to not make him uncomfortable, that even meant not holding hands walking to class. He eventually gave up and wouldn't even say \"Hi\" if i walked in, instead he'd pack up and leave the room quickly and silently.\n\nNeedless to say he doesn't have to worry about that now, but throughout our relationship he was always very weird about their relationship, texting her saying \"i really wish you were here, i miss you so much, i'm so stupid and i hate myself, you don't care about me\" because he knew she was with my family and I for my birthday dinner. Things like that happened all the time. He would constantly try to get her to spend the night or say he would watch all the girly movies she likes with her. Trying to do the \"Can i get a hug\" thing. \n\nShe was never a very intimate person to begin with and still has a huge stigma around sex because she came from a really religious household, she is getting over it, but its a slow and understandable process.\n\nNow with us broken up, hes already been pushy for hangouts and sleepovers and i have no doubt all he's wanted is more than that. If or when she turns him down he will be absolutely horrid to her and his reaction will just make things worse. I'm just worried that will hurt her more, and with the way she's feeling now i don't want to see her get hurt, or be told her best friend of 2 years was in it only for the chance at sex.\n\nIt's gross that some people think that way and it can seriously crush someone if they find out their friend was only in it so you can maybe touch his peep or show him your tits.",

But those are usually individual bad habits that are easier to fix because they don't have the deep-seated jerkitude behind them.\n\nThe good news is that a Nice Guy can change. I have known guys who went for years with a sucky romantic life and who constantly alienated women who finally sat down with a trusted friend and asked to be told honestly what they were doing wrong. More importantly, they listened and tried to change their off-putting behaviors, and I can't think of one who didn't eventually find real love after that.\n\nBut you have to want to change.\n\nThere's one of those parody motivational posters that says, \"The only consistent factor in all your dysfunctional relationships is you.\" There's a big ole chunk of truth in that. So if you are reading this and you think you might be a Nice Guy and you can't imagine why you aren't in a relationship, you might want to give that a think. Here's a few other friendly tips, free of charge from me to you:\n\nIf a woman doesn't find you funny, it might not be because she has no sense of humor. And telling her as much isn't going to make her like you any better.\n\nNo woman owes you her attention, her time, her interest, her admiration, or her love, no matter how worthy you think you are of them.\n\nYou are not entitled to have a relationship in your life just because you want one.\n\nIf you really aren't getting any women, it might be time to ask yourself (or someone you trust to be honest) what YOU could be doing differently.\n\nHitting on a woman when she's talking to you about her problems is just not cool. Especially if they are relationship problems.\n\nIf you can't be friends with a woman who's turned you down, especially if you find yourself getting really angry about it, you have no business being in a relationship until you work out your issues.\n\nWomen generally try hard to make themselves appealing to men when they are interested in or going out with them. So take a shower, brush your teeth, put on nice clothes, and for gods' sakes if you are hoping to get laid, wash your dick. Don't expect her to overlook you being slovenly and foul just because you think you have such a sterling personality.\n\nNo matter what you think, you will eventually fuck up in a relationship. Deal with it maturely and move on, and don't try to scam chicks out of their current relationships by selling yourself as the perfect partner.\n\nDon't for the love of pete be Mr. Bad Touch. If she just squirmed over a few inches, it's not because she wants you to close the distance.\n\nFlirting without expecting a return on investment is ok. Active seduction when there are clear signs that it is welcome is ok. Trying to constantly slip in \"innocent\" gropes, innuendo, kisses, or anything else when she's not interested is the adult equivalent of \"are we there yet? are we there yet? how about now? how about now?\"\n\nBody language and nonverbal cues are not that hard to learn to read.\n\nIf she says you're being obnoxious, there is a really good chance that you are being obnoxious. Even if you think you're all kinds of witty and clever.\n\nLikewise, if she says something you did was weird or pushy or unwelcome, mocking her \"paranoia\" or getting defensive or saying it was \"just a joke\" doesn't make you right-- it makes you a jerk. Respect how she perceives you. You might think she was oversensitive, but you have no idea what it is like to be a woman in a world where we have to deal with unwelcome aggressive attention all the time. Treat her feelings as valid even if you \"didn't mean it that way\". She will respect you more for it.\n\nWe can sense your hostility. It is a turnoff.\n\nBring something to the table besides basic human decency. I'm not talking about money. Be responsible for yourself, your life, and your happiness. Have good things in your life that you want to share with a wonderful woman, rather than expecting her to fill the holes in your life. Even if you're a nice loser, you're still a loser.\n\nThank you for listening, and best of luck in your future.",

That's pretty \"nice\" I think, even though I don't think of it like that, and she does try to repay me a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo is being a nice guy just constantly kissing ass and being afraid to do anything that isn't nice? Like, I still treat her as if she's a human being and she's a friend. Which, of course, comes with sarcastic humour, cracking jokes, ask her how her day way, tell each other about our hobbies, what tv shows we're watching, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike is that the difference between just being nice and being nice alongside being fun to be with?

We met and she was nice enough but I wasn't attracted to her, physically or mentally. We hung out twice, and I just wasn't into her. About a week later, I got a text message from her that was basically identical in content to the ones I had sent girls in the past. \n\nI was floored. It took me until I was 20 years old to realize just how awkward I had been for so long, and the awkward position I had put others in by acting that way. I honestly had no idea how to respond to a message that was so honest and emotional, when I felt nothing in return. \n\nIn the end, I called her and explained that I didn't feel the same way, and that it wasn't anything she did. I felt like after receiving a terse text back so many times, the least I could do was not treat her the same way I knew would lead to feelbads. \n\nBut it opened my eyes so much. It changed the way I thought about women, and I realized that putting someone you are into on a pedestal does no good for either person. It became easier for me to just be myself, and gave me confidence I hadn't had before. A year later I met someone I had a real connection with, not one I'd built in my head, and we're still together after 7 years.\n\nTo answer your question, sometimes it takes actually experiencing the other side of the table to understand how it feels.",

They may never realize they're not actually nice.\n\nThe other nice guy is someone who is honestly nice but can't see why he's not attractive and doesn't understand there's more to attraction than being nice. I'd say I was the latter kind. I'd feel bad even thinking that I was entitled to someone loving me just because I was nice but I was also honestly confused why someone wouldn't want to be with me if I was as nice as people said I was. As an adult I looked around and realized nice is good for friends and makes for good company, but relationships are more than that. There's having a good repartee, a back and forth between couples that's unique. A sexual attraction, a physical and mental need to- plainly put- FUCK a person. A spiritual fulfillment that goes beyond friendship, brotherhood and sex just by being together.\n\nMidway through college I stopped being the nice stranger because, sadly, there's no time for that as an adult. You can't listen and be there for every person that needs it. Over time, girls that I was only acquainted with showed me much more interest than my friends who I tried to always be  there for and that makes sense! To my friends, I'm a nice guy and I'm happy to be that. To strangers, I'm just another person and they judge me based on first impressions, on looks, on whatever charisma I might have. \n\nMy first partner said it so well I can only paraphrase it but basically she said she was glad she didn't listen to her (our mutual) friend, I wasn't a nice guy, I was more interesting. That felt better than being called a nice guy ever did. It sucks to say it but the people who flirt with me don't do it because I'm nice. You don't have to stop being nice you just have to stop using that as your measure of a person.",

Better to be safe than sorry. Why would you want to take any risk overstimulating the emotional responses of someone twice your size pumped with testosterone? Can be very scary.\n\nI'm sorry about your terrible experiences with rejection. Women are definitely capable of inflicting damage, also, when they don't get their way.",

She's still gorgeous, and I'd still probably (provided I'm single) date her at the drop of a hat if she ever reciprocated...\n\nBut she doesn't find me attractive, and (this is the part that takes time) *that's fine, it's all good!* Like, the only two things you can do about this are accept it or stop talking to her (which *is* a huge asshole move). \n\nMight take time to accept it but if both of you are mature & not manipulative then it should be all good in the end.\n\nI think what helped me break out of the whole \"omg im a nice guy stuck in the friendzone all the time\" is finding people that actually *wanted* to be FWB's.

The girl later told group leaders that Dick wouldn't stop asking if she'd had to throw away her soiled panties and it was making her uncomfortable.\n\nThis isn't related to an instance with a girl, but another time during a \"lock in\" (essentially a giant co-ed church sleepover), some kid got a bloody nose and as a joke shoved a (clean) tampon up there to absorb the blood. Later that night, the same kid walked in to the bathroom to find Dick jerking it crazily with the bloodied tampon string tied around his cock. Dick got sent home, and the group leaders tried to keep it quiet but the kid who'd witnessed it told *everyone*. ",

I just believed that relationships were a natural result of connecting through friendships and I believed that sexuality was something special, worth waiting for, and taking it slow. \n\nIn my inexperience I simply had never even heard of the stuff I see on reddit. The whole concept of people declaring \"exclusivity\" down the line was the most devastating thing to my view on relationships. I definitely could see myself being a \"nice guy\" if I had spent more time around girls and had been rejected a bunch of times. \n\nA \"nice guy\" is offended when he's rejected because he had wrongly immersed himself in the fantasy that relationships just happen like magic. That he's a complex person looking for a connection and that maybe there could be some magic that would let her feel the same way towards him. Basically he ignores all the logical details of a relationship like appearance (not to say his crush wasn't based on appearance, but he's likely ignorant enough to think it wasn't) and sees people as special and unique.\n\nI think reddit really gets it wrong when they say nice guys are \"entitled\" for getting upset at rejection. They legitimately had set up a whole fantasy about a life with that person, spending weeks thinking about them, and getting the courage to ask them out. To a \"nice guy\", it isn't a numbers game or a flirty sexual connection. Remember, a \"nice guy\" is inexperienced and probably sees the vast majority of women as attractive, especially his female friends and projects that idea onto the women, assuming they feel similarly about their guy friends. So when a nice guy is rejected he truly feels as if he's been designated less than human. I believe given that, it's quite a natural response to lash out with insults.\n\nTL:DR; A \"nice guy\" doesn't even see relationships as an immediate avenue to sex, contrary to reddit's liberal view of relationships being entirely based on sex.

The issue is when guys get insistent that you should 'give them a chance'/expect sex or devalue the friendship.\n\nMy best friend had feelings for me at some point, I wasn't interested. He was respectful of that and didn't bring it up again, even later said that our friendship was very important to him when we were very very drunk. We've been friends for ten years since then, we're both in committed relationships and he wants me to be in his wedding party. \n\nI think respect and remembering that a platonic friendship can be incredibly rewarding is the main thing. If you need to step back for a little bit to get over that person, so be it, but pressuring them is a bad idea.",

When I was younger, I always held on to the belief that you wait for \"someone special\" to come along, you get to know them slowly, become friends and then one day you both decide that you want to be more than that and then you become a couple. That is still my ideal sort of relationship in my little fantasy world. I guess the main difference is that, even when I met someone with that potential, I never really expected them to reciprocate or feel the same way. And then, the first time they did, it turned out that we really weren't right together. It was still a numbers game and waiting for that right person and trying not to be disappointed when someone you thought was the one didn't work out. I had to learn a lot from those few failed relationships about what worked for me and what didn't. What I was willing to work on or compromise myself and what I needed the other person to just accept about me. There is so much more to a relationship than just those giddy lovey butterflies at the beginning. There has to be equity in what both of you give and take. You have to respect eachother and yourself. You have to understand your partner's view on relationships and sex and romance and be compatible with their needs. \n\nThe thing is, when you take all of these little pieces and details that need to be just right in order for a relationship to happen and go well, it is pretty magical when you find it.

Why don't I want to kiss him? He's done nothing wrong and we've been going out for months, why am I not in love yet?\"\n\nA lot of heartache later, I figured out a couple of things: romantic attraction isn't just the natural evolution of friendly affection, and I've been aromantic this entire time.

He believes when driving, its **OK** To go 5-10 miles over the speed limit.

As if I was trying to rub my knowledge of words in her face. It was an ongoing theme in our relationship. She constantly felt like I was trying to make her seem stupid. It was really stifling. Talking to her became like walking on eggshells and I was constantly worried that I would inadvertently say something that made her feel stupid. She also would get mad at me for other weird small things, and get even more mad at me when I couldn't just magically figure out that she was upset. She'd be quiet for a while and then start yelling at me, and when I said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't realize anything was wrong,\" she would say, \"Well, I shouldn't have to say anything, you should just know!\" Yeah, that relationship went nowhere.",

Typically, grandma's the sweetest most polite lady you'd ever meet, but catch her when her blood sugar is real low and her filter completely vanishes). So anyways, at some point someone brings up the idea of going to see a movie and so my uncle told me to pull up listings to see what movies were playing. So as I'm going down the list, nothing looks too good, then I see Jurassic World and remember that I had been eagerly awaiting this new one to come out. The moment I bring it up, my aunt shoots me a death glare through the rear-view mirror and my uncle instantly changes the conversation. At this point I'm very confused, thinking ok maybe for some strange reason they both really despised the old Jurassic park films?? So after a minute or so of my uncle just rambling on about nothing, trying to change the conversation, I turn to my little cousin in the back seat with me and ask her if she had ever seen Jurassic Park. She starts talking \"No my parents don't-\" then out of nowhere, my grandma bursts out \"These two dipshits have her brainwashed into thinking dinosaurs never existed because it doesn't fit their batshit crazy evangelical narrative.\" Everyone went silent for a few minutes while I'm sitting in the back trying my best not to burst out laughing then my aunt started getting on about her needing to check her blood sugar and yeah, that was how I learned that there are actually real people out there who truly believe this shit.",

Very well done, dim lights, etc.  A giant raptor behind a velvet rope would do this hunting routine: sniff the ground, swing it''s head along the bushes, pause looking directly at the viewer, then raise up and look off into the distance and make a calling sound. I watched it cycle a few times and tried to imagine running into one for real. Then some little kid (asshat) maybe 10 years old? came in sans parents, grabbed a huge handful of sand from the exhibit and chucked it at the raptor animation. I was kind of pissed, not only at his rude behavior but also I was thinking the sand might ruin the workings of a great exhibit. He grabbed a second handful and I warned him \"If you make them angry, they might bite you\". He rolled his eyes and wound up to throw a second fistful of sand, when I stepped forward and snapped my fingers, getting the raptor's attention (it seemed) and it swung it's head over to the kid's position, it's rubber lips puling back to expose a mouthful of death. Sand-kid turned white, and bolted from the room. Obviously, I had just timed by actions to correspond with the pre-programmed animation, but for a moment at least one bratty kid thought I could summon live dinosaurs.  ",

As a junior in high school, 17 years old, she still didn't know \"which\" World War the Germans were in, and whether or not the Germans were \"the bad guys.\"  I was told that I was a big ol' meanie head for feeling that this girl was stupid or overly sheltered for saying these things but like you, I *don't* get it.  First off, the first lesson I ever got on WW2 was in 3rd, *maybe* 4th grade.  We learned about the Holocaust and the Japanese internment camps and the bombing of Hiroshima in elementary school.  If you think that was early, well, I disagree, but schools *definitely* start covering this in 6th grade at the latest.  And even if you've never stepped foot in a school in your life, it truly is the most dominant force in recent history.  My grandparents lived through it, and mentioned it.  References, both direct and allegorical, are made in literature, film, television, every type of media.  By the time we were learning in history books in 3rd or 4th grade, we were already aware that WW2 had happened, in a sense that \"Americans and English were the good guys, Germans and Japanese were the bad guys, Hitler was mean to the Jews\" was assumed to be common knowledge for elementary schoolers.\n\nHow someone can make it to high school, much less adulthood, without ever seeing a TV program, article, or history lesson on the topic blows my mind.  I don't even think it's possible.  They must be actively blocking out information.",

Anyway, one time (approx. 2003) I had an assignment for English (or whatever) due to be emailed in about 20 minutes that I hadn't even started. I'm a smart person, I do really well in school (college anyway), but I am a horrible procrastinator! So I was panicked and I googled whatever the assignment was, copy and pasted what I found on some website and turned that in as my assignment. Within about an hour of the end of the due date/time I got an email from my teacher that was literally just the definition of plagiarism (probably copied and pasted from encyclopedia.com btw...) and her telling me I was facing serious trouble. \n\nThis was pretty late at night, as most assignments are due by 11pm-12am, so when I got the email I INSTANTLY wrote up my assignment and cited my source (the one I copied/pasted and emailed to her), waited until about 8 the next morning, and replied to her email by saying \"OMG, I'm SO sorry, I must have accidentally attached the source I used for my assignment rather than the actual assignment! Here's my report (with my source cited) and I'm extremely sorry for the mix-up, I would never plagiarize anything, etc. etc.)\"\n\nShe. Fucking. Bought it. I didn't get in trouble, my mom never found out, I maybe got marked down a little on the assignment for being \"late\" to turn in, I think she might have told me to be more careful next time, and I graduated with no issue. \n\nAs much as I did what I did on purpose, knowing it was bad, I was legitimately panicked the entire time and praying (first) that I wouldn't get caught and (second) I'd get away with my story about the mix-up. Looking back though, I have to say, my \"save\" was pretty ingenious....",

As a former high school student I'll share my clever way of cheating.\n\nWe were required to take 4 state tests a year. All these tests were just reprints of actual tests from a few years ago. I knew the answer key would be online, but all I had to do was find out which year it was. So we had 2 days to complete this test in class. \n\nDay 1 (math, science, english, history). Teacher handed out the test and literally on the front page was the year this test took place. I went through each test and made mental notes of the questions and order they were in just to confirm nothing changed on the answer key.\n\nSo I get home and google each test and bam! Each answer key is there. Now, in all my classes expect for one I was right next to the teachers so I had to conjure up a sneaky way to copy down the right answers. \n\nSo what I did was, I went to walmart and picked up brand new wooden pencils and colored erasers. I color coded each pencil with a different color to differentiate them.\n\nOn the answer key it was ABCD, so with a razor blade I engraved different marks for each key. Example:\n\nA) = /\n\nB) = |\n\nC) = -\n\nD) = \\\n\nThere was about 100 questions and I managed to fit all the answers on 2 sides of the pencil. So if the teacher got up to walk around all I had to do was rotate the pencil away from him/her.\n\nEvery 10 questions I would engrave a circle so that If I ever lost count I could count by tens.\n\nDay 2: All I had to do was circle the correct answer and obviously I purposely missed at least 4. Totally worked because this was a major grade and I barely passed math because of this method.\n\nI would like to add, I could've easily studied and passed, but me being the rebel teenager that I was I wanted to show no mercy.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention I sold each pencil to a friend for $5.

It would take a week or so per class (finals) but it was worth it.  It looked inconspicuous in case a teacher checked so I could say it was something like a program to find the lengths of a side of a triangle but if you entered the secret code it would open up so you could choose a math or science section such as physics, calculus, etc with anything you could possibly need.

All through middle school and high school, I'd program the formulas for everything into the TI-83 that I had, and just solve every problem by plugging numbers into the program.  I shared it with everyone in class who wanted them.  The teachers agreed that was within the rules as well.\n\nWhen we were doing ellipses in pre-calc, for instance, I just made a program for it.  You gave it the formula and it graphed the ellipse with axes, and printed the (x,y) of each focus, the midpoint, etc.\n\nYou can also use the built-in functions for many things.  If you have two equations and two vars, you just graph both lines and find the intercept, which will give you the value of x and y.  I once had a slight problem doing this since we were expected to show work, but my test was blank except for the correct answer, circled below each problem.  Had to show the teacher how I was doing it before she agreed I wasn't somehow cheating.\n\nThere were only a few kinds of problems for which this kind of thing was infeasible.  Geometry class was the primary source of these problems, such as proofs of geometric properties, and things like finding the perimeter of an irregular shape.  For calculus as well it wasn't possible to program in TI basic, but the TI-89 does symbolic differentiation and integration so you just get one of those and you're good.\n\n\n\nEdit:  I've had some conversations with other professors about fuck-ups who get caught cheating in Comp Sci, and it's always because they just turn in someone else's code with minimal changes (usually it's char-for-char verbatim).  If you're gonna turn in someone else's code, there's a simple set of rules you can use to get away with it.  Some of these tricks are also used by virus writers to try to obfuscate reverse-engineering.\n\n1) Rename every variable, class, and method/function.\n\n2) Use different, but equivalent, types.  If they're using arrays, use lists.  If they're using dictionaries, use arrays of custom objects.  Custom objects are magic for making code look unique.  Make tons of them, even if they aren't necessary.\n\n3) Re-order the logic within each method so that it's equivalent in function, but out of order. If they declare and init local vars ad-hoc, you instead declare all your local vars at the top of the method, and init them ad-hoc.  Re-order the methods within each class semi-randomly (I.E. still grouping related methods, but otherwise scrambled)\n\n4) Change logic to equivalent logic.  If they're using a single for loop to iterate through a double array, using the mod and div method, you instead use multiple nested for loops.\n\n5) Don't turn it in the same week they do, unless the due date arrives.\n\n6) Make sure their fucking name isn't on it.",

I picked up another one and slipped it into my backpack when he wasn't looking.  The next exam came around and so did another preparation sheet.

You may not pick it all up but you'll have a scanned base that your conscious choice can get a gut feeling for (you pick up more than you realize).\n\n2. Sit in the back. \n\n3. Knock out the questions you can with confidence.\n\n4. Figure out the questions your close to getting - put a star next to these.\n\n3. Ask a ton of questions spaced to hear out so you have an opportunity to walk to the front where the teach is and back. For each trip look for one question's answer on every test you walk by. You'll see that just by walking by you can get a lot of information through glances. Knock out about 5 of these.\n\n4. For super hard questions, same tactic as bullet 3 but prioritize these for last. Even just a glance can get you going in the right direction even if you can't make out the answer.\n\n5. If this doesn't get you a C, you're an idiot.\n\nSource: I'm a sneaky bastard.",

Anyways it was no feat to just decode it. But apparently only some of the students figured how to do it, and we did not tell anyone else. eventually the tests got more and more obscure, and complex to tackle.\n\nIt eventually required learning about SQL injection, Rainbow Tables, Hashing, all sorts of things to get at the answer and not have to study for the dumb tests. We were all bamboozled! At the end of the year he went to the five of us that had managed to overcome every puzzle and not study a single day any of his lessons and said to us: \"Work smarter not harder, you all did splendidly to learn more than your peers.\" He fucking got us to do things way outside the scope of the class, and we learned quite a bit more than anyone else.

Naturally, since I was a total nerd in high school, I didn't have to do any work in second semester. \n\nThis was my junior year, though, and I was actually starting to blossom and open up and try to be 'cool' a little bit. So one week, I got in trouble for talking during class with my friend and she moved me closest to her desk, and my friend to the back. \n\nWe had a test that week. Another of her policies is that we get the test one day prior, to just go over the questions for 10 minutes in class, then we hand them back to the teacher, and we actually take the test the next day.\n\nSince I was first and closest to her desk that week... she gave me the first copy, which had the fucking answer key stapled to it as the last page. As soon as I saw it and realized what I was holding I quietly detached the last page and stashed it in my desk, and took it out only at the end of the period. \n\nThat day I definitely became the cool kid for a few weeks. lol",

Apple dodging most of its tax burden probably looks like cheating. You have to think like a cheater, act like one, and then maybe dial it back a notch so you're juuuust barely on the right side of the law. \n\nI study and do my homework like a good cow.
