So her parents are real hippies, live at least 40 minutes from the nearest town which doesn't have much anyway, they live on an Eco friendly farmlet which her parents built from scratch. Since the age of say 10? She's now 16, my boyfriends sister has been a stealer of money. Started off by taking coins when she was babysitting for neighbours eventually finding out where stashes of cash were kept and then the neighbours found out and told her parents. They were mortified but didn't do much apart from tell her off and make her promise she wouldn't do it again. Little things like that happened and same outcome. Then her grandad passed away who left a share of $1mil to her mother which was used to upgrade the farm buy more land etc. she stole money from her dead granddads wallet in his fucking pocket when he was lying in the house dead when no one was looking. All she got was a bit of a tell off. She never has to give the money back because she spends it first. Her parents just say 'work it off' by doing chores. Now she's 16 and her latest crimes have been stealing her mums card to buy $800USD of makeup online. Her parents took the make up from her hoping to return it but not before she replaced the make up in the boxes with old bottles. They let her keep the make up still let her do all her school camps, parties etc. the last I heard, her parents started a BnB, made a couple of grand only to have it disappear because she found out their internet banking passwords transferred it to herself, then spent it on food, friends, make up all in a weekend before they could find out. Her punishment? Working it off by doing chores. It makes me sick. I had to do chores for free! I'm still doing chores for free in my own house. Fucking hell",

When his son turned 16, Don was ready to *give* him his PRISTINE Volkswagen. Don really babied his cars, so this Jetta, though about seven years old, was truly in like-new condition, a car that most normal 16 year olds would be thrilled to have. I would have been thrilled to have it myself! So Don tells his son the plan and his son goes \"Dad, I'm not driving THAT car. It's a seven year old Jetta. I need a new pickup truck.\" After taking a deep breath so he didn't throttle his son, Don simply said \"Well, then, I'll drive the Jetta for one more year and then give it to your sister when she's 16. If you want a new pickup truck then you'll either have to ask your mother or buy one yourself.\" Now Don and his kids' mother had been divorced for years and, through a series of bad choices, his ex-wife had barely two dimes to rub together. Don had gotten remarried to a woman who was a very successful and wealthy business owner. So his son (very mistakenly) thought that Don and his current wife would foot the bill for whatever the son wanted; how very wrong he was... Fast forward a year, his daughter is very happily driving the Jetta. Don bought himself a brand new Mazda. His son has access to neither of them. In desperation, his son bought himself a crappy $800 beater just to get himself to and from work. Lesson learned, I hope. I applaud Don for sticking to his guns and teaching his kid not to be an entitled asshole at an early age...",

I looked at her and said, \"Money's tight?\" She related the tale of how the kids have no idea that they have money. It was the way she was raised. She didn't discover the money until she graduated university. At first, she was pissed because her college could have been *so* much easier with money but, a few months after graduation, she started thinking back on how pissed off she had been at the wealthy kids who just bought their way out of every problem that came their way and how disgusted she had been at the way they lived their lives. She apologized to her dad and swore that she would raise her kids exactly the same way. She lives in a modest little house. Her boys wear sneakers until they destroy them.

(I would actually report this to the school if it wouldn't be blatantly obvious who did it. Her mom is an educator and should know better.) She once had her boyfriend drive four hours out (and another four back) to come pick her up during a family trip because she didn't have a space private enough to focus on her school work, even though we were all sharing rooms and dealing with the lack of space equally (her mom ended up doing that school work for her). Her parents even offered to give her the master bedroom to herself, which would've had two of us sleeping on the floor. I should mention, this girl is 22 and in college. She does have a sales job, which she's surprisingly *really good* at, which is why I think she still has hope of being a productive adult. ",

Personally I had a lot of scholarships going into it where I wouldn't have to pay the 52k a year they were humorously asking for. At the time they had very lax acceptance policy but was considered a great school, which had the interesting result of attracting very rich kids who weren't interested in the school for its academics but more for its parties / night life of the town/city it was in. In my dorm freshman year there was a girl who supposedly is a descendant of the Versace (sp?) family of some sort. After seeing the money she'd blow nonchalantly, I was inclined to believe it. Almost every weekend there'd be a knock on our door as she ran through the halls asking who was coming with her on her trip this weekend. She didn't mean her trip to the grocery store, or even a trip home. She meant whatever trip she was planning around the world that weekend. Sometimes it was Paris, others was Australia, Bali, wherever her little heart desired. She'd fly out to these exotic places for WEEKENDS, not 3 day weekends, not holiday breaks, just your average friday/saturday/sunday. And she would be gobsmacked and sometimes insulted when after a moment of stunned silence, you tell her that you couldn't possibly go with her to Paris for 3 days let alone afford a last minute ticket to Paris. She literally just couldn't comprehend that normal people couldn't afford those things. oh she also 'lived in the dorms' because she was a freshman and you couldn't live off campus as a freshman... but she really lived off campus in what I would later find out to be a 4 grand a month apartment by herself with a house cleaner who'd come everyday. She was the most detached-from-reality person I've ever met. And of course she was drop dead gorgeous. She'll probably never experience a 'hard time' in her entire life, or have to work a single day. Edit: everyone is guessing schools, it hasn't been guessed yet, but I don't want to give the name of the school as it was a pretty small school so it wouldn't be too hard to figure out her name or my name from it ",

One of those tables had authentic high-quality nutcrackers made by professional woodworkers or something like that. So my uncle goes over, sees a nutcracker dressed like a old-timey sea captain and is looking it over because it's really cool looking and he was considering buying it for his dad as a christmas gift. He notices the price tag and it's way out of his range, it was a few hundred dollars I think, but he keeps on admiring it. Along comes a little girl in a christmas dress, about 7/8 years old. She wrenches the nutcracker out of my uncle's hands and shows it to her mom. My uncle was in complete shock at what had just happened, and at first the mom looks like she was appalled as well. But then the mom just smiles sweetly and says \"Is that the one you want?\" And the girl nods and the mom buys it for her. And my uncle and the cashier just stand there in shock. TL;DR Little girl grabs a very expensive wooden nutcracker out of my uncle's hands while he's still looking at it, presents it to her mom and proceeds to purchase it.",

Now that I'm writing it, some of these aren't bad, I just had never seen that level of wealth IRL before. He was kind of a brat about cleaning after himself, though. ",

Devil_child was 4 or 5, and lived with his mom and grandmother, and sometimes his uncle when he as out of jail every few months. Devil_child was an only child, and could do no wrong. Mom & grandma would drive Devil_child to school with him sitting in the front seat. They said he won't let them leave if he's in the back. If they all three go somewhere, Devil_child sits in the front seat. They also carried him from the car to the front door, because he was their baby. They would also carry him from the front door back to the car. He never walked when they were around him. Ever. One day during craft time, Devil_child was doing something wrong and the other room teacher put her hand over his to stop him. He snatched his hand away and said, \"If you touch me again, I'll stab you in the head with the scissors. Sometimes I hit my grandma so hard it hurts her hand.\" The last story I've got about him was the tone we did a neighborhood walk. Devil_child devised he was don't with us and started running sassy from the group. The road we were on was very quiet, but it intersected with one of the city's busiest thoroughfares. I caught up with him and carried him back. The whole time he was scratching and kicking me. When we got back, we sat in a room by ourselves. The room had one of those half doors, so anyone could see in. He ran around knocking stuff off shelves and tipping over buckets with stuff like Legos in them. He started getting physical, so I restrained him in my lap. He managed to scratch my face and kick me in the testicles during a struggle to get him still. When mom came, I told her the story, she looked past me, and the cunt said, \"My poor baby, come here. Are you ok?\" I'm guessing by now he's probably killed and buried them in the back yard, along with the others I don't know about. I'd bet he's been made into an episode of Criminal Minds, too.",

Anyway, right after our graduation, her family was set to go on another big holiday. It was a little hard hearing about how she'd be visiting all these places AGAIN while i was still yet to go once, but i loved her so naturally my happiness for her over rode any jealousy. That was, right up until their family decided to cancel a stop off in Japan on the way home. For a solid week she whinned about how unfair it was that she wouldn't get to visit Japan. I flipped the fuck out. She was still visiting at least 6 european countries and spending a month and a half traveling, and all she could think about was how she would get to see Japan? I definitely lost my cool in that situation. But it also helped her to put it in perspective.",

My former step-mother was both a sociopath, and bipolar. It was a very unfortunate combination. She spent a few thousand on clothes each week. She would fly to Vegas once a month for a few hours to get her hair done by her favorite stylist. She failed out of nursing school but managed to get back into the program by lying to the dean that she had been battling breast cancer (she has never had any kind of cancer). She demanded that once she finished the program that my dad buy her an $80,000 car as a graduation present. She destroyed my family's home movies of me and my sibling's childhood when my dad threatened to break it off with her. I'm 99% sure she beat my dad. She claimed to have \"back problems\" that no doctor was able to substantiate, so she had a handicapped placard and refused to work, while walking around in high heels everywhere. After my sister got a restraining order against her, she got my sister detained by claiming that she had seen my sister participate in an assault that happened a few blocks away, but when none of the other witnesses, including the victim, recognized anyone who looked even remotely like my sister, she lawyered up and claimed \"oops, my mistake\". She was an active Mormon who spent ~6 months as a nurse for the father (who had dementia) of the local bishop, during which time she stole meds from him regularly. She got the other two mormons in my family, my sister and my father, kicked out of the church by claiming that my father beat her (he's a pacifist), and that my sister was a drug dealer (my sister is an ER nurse and triathlete). She claimed to other people in the church that she personally raised me and my brothers (she didn't even like to come out of the bedroom on the weekends we were visiting), and that our mom was a drug addicted prostitute (my mom's a firefighter and EMT, and worked ~60 hours a week for my siblings and me; easily the most inspiring person I know). Unfortunately my dad has self-confidence issues so he didn't want to leave her for the longest time, and as a result whatever she wanted from him, she got. My siblings and I still love our father, and we visit him regularly, but that lack of self-confidence is his biggest character flaw. It was a first-hand view of the textbook abusive relationship. It was never a secret that we didn't like her. I remember once, after we were all adults, he asked if she could go to the movies with us. He used the argument that if the Devil himself were in the theater with us, as long as the Devil was quiet we wouldn't even notice. My response was that if she was going to be there then the Devil had better sit between us.",

She gives her order, and turns to the kids to say in the same tone, \"You need to sit down.\" I'm not sure if the kids hear her or not, but one decided to get out and start running around. Mom interacts with the person serving her before turning around to tell the kid they need to get back in the cart. She hasn't even raised her voice yet. The kid ignores her. He runs over to a rack of dessert cakes and grabs a box. He yells over to his mother and holds the box up triumphantly. She looks over and says \"No. We're not buying that.\" She doesn't sound convinced. Seeing their sibling with a box of chocolate dessert cakes, the other child dashes over and grabs a pair of boxes of their own. Not to be outdone, Abomination #1 grabs another box and they head back to the cart. Mom watches them come back over and says, in that same defeated voice, \"I said no. You have to put them back.\" The kids respond by slam-dunking the boxes into the cart proudly, happy at their success. Mom looks at the whole situation and finally decides to lay down an ultimatum. \"I don't know.\" She muses, \"Are you going to eat those?\" The kids scream triumphantly in the affirmative and Mom relents, walking off with the kids and their snack cakes.

It was a family joke even now good I was at saving money, that I kept the first dollar I'd earner and whatnot. Example - growing up my dad always said he'd pay for half of our first car, we had to work and save the rest of the money. He pays for half of older sisters car ($4000, so he paid $2000). My turn comes, suddenly it isn't half, it's just $2000 towards whatever, so I pay $3500 he pays $2000 for my $5500 car. And I saved that money at a $5.25/hour part time job too, took forever. Younger sister? He pays half, more than $2000. I think around $3000. Still kinda salty about it. Pretty sure it was because my sisters couldn't scrape up more than half but they knew I had it. I guess jokes on them tho, I am more financially secure than them nowadays and generally better managing money, and my car is nicer!",

He knew he would never drive again but since I was just about to get my driving license next year he gave his car to my parents for me. It was old, nothing fancy but in good shape and hey, free car. I guess one day I wasn't in a nice mood (stupid teenage years) and started bitching about the car. How it wasn't sporty enough and a boring colour and I wanted a car with mags and a spoiler and a sound system...Honestly I didn't care. I was more than happy to get a free car but I wasn't to step on my stupid pride and admit it. Just before my 16th birthday my father told me they sent the car to a shop to fix some minor body damage and have the windshield replaced. The day of my 16th birthday, my father show up with \"my\" car. Before my grandfather died, he had heard I wasn't happy with his old boring car so he gave money to my parents so they could get the car repainted. I got the car the colour I loved, with a spoiler and some cheapo mags, a CD player to replace the tape player and better speakers. Never felt more like a spoiled brat. I was truly and honestly happy with the car as it was, but because I threw a stupid tantrum one day for some probably stupid reason my grandfather felt bad he was giving me a boring old car and even as he was dying he wanted me to be happy. I'm 29 now and fuck how I wish I could still thank him for the car and everything else.",

I was more than happy being the backup goalie and playing wing most of the time. Most of the \"goalies\" had both skating gear and goalie gear. The coach would always figure out the better goalie and that person would play 75% of the games in goal and skate for the other 25%. One year, I tried out a a goalie for team picks. I was the 3rd pick for a team and another goalie was the last pick. The coach told me I'd be starting goalie and the other mom throws a FIT because her son should get to be goalie because he's actually focused on being a goalie and not skating. Coach says \"Fine... (shitty goalie) starts the first half of the season. (Me) starts the second half of the season.\" We barely win a game the first half of the season despite leading the league in goals. It's finally my turn, so I come to the rink with my goalie gear and the kids mom sees my goalie stick and runs to the coach and says \"My son has to start because we sold all of his skating gear.\" We were like 12, in a non-checking league, so goalie injuries are VERY rare, and you can dress someone for goalie if something happens, so NO ONE had a backup goalie on the bench. This kid seriously dressed as a backup for two games until the league finally FORCED my coach to play him since he doesn't have skating gear. ",

She just infuriates me in the new season. She was always a bit spoiled and entitled, but she didn't always use it as an excuse to be lazy. She was a type-A, hard-working go-getter. And then the sequel ruined her. Things Rory did to reveal what a horrible, lazy, no-talent writer she is (now): - She didn't have any ideas to pitch to Conde Nast. And barely any past work. Just, \"Hello, I'm Rory Gilmore, I wrote one article, clearly I am amazing, give me a job.\" No. - She agreed to write the article about lines in NYC, even though she thought it was stupid. First of all, don't accept an assignment you hate - if you're predetermined to view it as dumb, you won't give it its due. Second, what's stupid about that?! It could be fascinating, fun to research and tons of interesting angles to write about. Old Rory could really dig in and create something amazing. Remember the first article she wrote for The Franklin? > When you've got a reporter who can take an incredibly mundane and seemingly unimportant subject like the re-paving of the faculty parking lot, and turn it into a bittersweet piece on how everybody and everything eventually becomes obsolete, then you've really got something. Miss Gilmore, I was touched. - WHERE DID THAT RORY GO? - So she stood in like two lines, passed another, and then got bored and gave up on the article. She saw people standing in line who didn't even know what the line was for; she found out it was for nothing, and she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away?? Nothing interesting to glean there about the psychology of lines? In one of the lines she *did* stand in, she fell asleep WHILE TALKING TO A SOURCE. In another, she *slept with* a source - one that she disdained and later mocked. She's just dripping with commitment and journalist integrity. - She gave up on the article and NEVER TOLD CONDE NAST. But still expected plum assignments to fall into her lap of course. - When she went for the interview at Sandee Says, she had *absolutely no ideas* to offer. She didn't prepare at all, she just expected to get it because, well, she's Rory Gilmore! She also couldn't even think on her feet to come up with ONE IDEA. Not one. Heck I could have come up with a few and I'm no journalist. Incredibly unprofessional to go to an interview completely unprepared. And then she was so mad that she didn't get the job. And let's not forget that she looked down on this job from the beginning. **The worst part of it all? She proved Mitchum Hunsberger right.**",

Her son had taken his computer with him and he was glued to the thing the entire time we were there. His gifts and food had to be delivered to him at the desk he was playing at. Christmas dinner that his Grandmother cooked specifically for him saw his place at the table empty while the rest of us got to listen to \"N**ger\" echo through the house as we ate. Easily the worst first introduction to a girlfriends family that I have ever had. So, counseling might be a long shot, but I do agree that it could help them. As for me?

It definitely answered any questions I may have had about the lethal capabilities of cereal box characters. And the creator ran a Kickstarter a long time ago to get it into print. So you may be able to buy it somewhere. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1912947775/this-complete-breakfast-of-the-gods-the-trade-coll One of the covers mimicking the \"Death Of Supergirl\" in DC's \"Crisis On Infinite Earth's.\" https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Iy-QvX1qv0E/SCC1jO91zOI/AAAAAAAACXg/EON3s4GrPgI/s320/BreakfastoftheGodsPromo.jpg A single page from the long and very entertaining story. http://onceuponageek.com/images/breakfast_gods.jpg Highly recommended.

The smaller mascots - birds, bees, frogs, rabbits, various elves, etc. - make a lot of noise but don't accomplish much except becoming appetizers for the larger animal mascots: Tony the Tiger, the Cookie Crisp wolf, Sugar Bear, etc. These ones put up a much stronger fight, but are ultimately outsmarted by the ingenuity of the human mascots: Life Cereal's Mikey eating the animals and liking it, Cap'n Crunch providing strategies while hoping no one notices he's really just a Commander, Fred Flintstone clubbing everything in sight into paste. The humans maintain control, until nightfall.... when the monsters come. The Fruit Brute tears people apart until he's run through by Cap'n Crunch's silver cutlass. Boo Berry provides an adequate distraction until the Ghostbusters (yes there was a Ghostbusters cereal) take him down. This gives Lucky the Leprechaun time to spread a marshmallowy pestilence from his cauldron across the whole of the coliseum, weakening them for the arrival of his master: Count Chocula. He preys upon the quickly dwindling survivors, streaking from victim to victim in flashes of brown almost too quick for the eye to see, only pausing long enough to feed from Sonny the Cuckoo Bird before finally and inevitably turning on Lucky too. He looms over the now still battleground, surveying the sugary carnage and basking in the glory of his victory. The Count turns his attention to the horizon as dawn begins to break and as he strides to the edge of the coliseum to leave, he finds that he cannot. No matter how hard he struggles or searches he cannot not cross its boundaries. The rules are clear: only ONE can exit. As Chocula struggles in vain to escape before the sun can rise high enough to shine down into the coliseum, his lapse in attention allows a single form to emerge from his waiting spot in the shadows and quietly approach him from behind. Before he can react a large iron-like hand closes around his neck, and in one fluid, powerful motion, crushes Chocula's head into the stonework of the floor. Skull fragments and chocolate sauce form a morbid mosaic across the ground underneath the remains of the Count's face. Although he cannot die from these injuries alone, it takes time to recover... time the Count did not have. The sun eventually crests over the coliseum walls, burning away the body in a gentle shower of sunlight and raisins. Frankenberry strides quietly off of the stained sands of the coliseum floor, out through the gates of the entrance and off into the distance, never to be seen.... until next Halloween when General Mills makes more.",

                    "body": "Death and Destruction: A Balanced Breakfast I still remember the day the note came to our door. \u201cCome one, come all, to the most glorious event since the Oatmeal Overthrow!\u201d It seemed like such a good idea at the time. Infinite financing and the unquestioned knowledge that we had the best cereal of them all. It was a dream come true. We had no idea what we lay ahead of us. The three of us, my brothers and I, had planned our strategy for weeks prior. Lay low for the beginning of the fight and wait for the biggest threats to fall under the weight of their own power. Take out the stragglers one at a time, using our small stature to sneak until an opening presented itself. It was the perfect plan. The last few seconds before the bell sounded were a lifetime each. I had never seen so many of my colleagues, my rivals, in person, all waiting in anticipation. Some passed the time joking with their neighbors. Toucan Sam and Tony the Tiger talked as if they had been friends for years. Others chose to solemnly await the beginning of the end. Captain Crunch stood silent, the memories of wars past present in his determined, yet sorrow laden eyes. BONGGGG The carnage began quicker than we could have ever imagined. Immediately, Tricks and Cuckoo, no doubt fueled by the ungodly mixture of sugar and methamphetamines in their respective bloodstreams, began clawing and biting at each other. Within seconds, Cuckoo had gouged Tricks\u2019 left eye out, while Tricks gnashed into Cuckoo\u2019s right wing, nearly taking it clean off. The blood, so much blood. My brother got sprayed from the hole where Tricks\u2019 eye used to be, staining his previously pristine yellow shirt. He stood in shock, as Cuckoo was taken aback by a flurry of swipes from Tricks. However, the tide turned as Cuckoo flipped Tricks to the ground and sank his talons into his gut. A bloody mist began to fill the air as Cuckoo took to the air, the remnants of his right wing barely able to lift the collective weight of the bird and his prey. \u201cSnap, run!\u201d I beckoned to my brother, as Cuckoo crumbled to his injuries, plummeting fast to the ground below. Snap looked up, but it was too late. Cuckoo and the corpse of Tricks crushed my brother, leaving myself and Pop stunned. \u201cNOOOOOOOOOO!\u201d Pop screamed to the heavens. Before we had time to grieve, Dig\u2019Em Frog ambushed us, brandishing his deadly spoon. Our weeks of training kicked in, as Pop ran headlong at the frog, while I ran around his back. Our pincer attack succeeded, as I drove my bark shiv deep into Dig\u2019Em\u2019s back, just as I heard a scream from his front. I was too slow. Pop stood still for a moment before falling over, the sharpened spoon wedged deep into his side. I threw the frog to the side and ran to comfort my brother in his final moments. \u201cCrackle...it hurts...oh god, it hurts\u2026\u201d He gasped out, reaching for an end to the pain that could not come. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Pop\u2026\u201d The tears streaming down my face dropping onto his limp body. \u201cPlease...please, just win...for Snap an\u2019 me?\u201d He managed to wheeze out before taking in his last deep breath. I gathered myself for a moment before making a break for the wall. The sprint took eons. In the background, Tony had Sam in his mouth, ripping the small bird apart. Captain Crunch had Lucky impaled on the end of his ship, while fighting off the dual assault of Frankenberry and Booberry. I managed to get to the wall, and the dark shadows that it brought, just as Buzz Bee came crashing into the section next to me in a blur of cinnamon, the trail leading back to Bob. I hid along the wall until nightfall, thinking it would be the safest time for me to take out the survivors. I was such a fool. A cold chill followed the darkness as it filled the arena. I stood silently, waiting to make my move when I heard the unmistakable wail of a fallen tiger. A freezing gust of wind rushed past me, as the blood curdling scream of Old Man Bob filled the arena. The screams came intermittently but always after the wind. Then, the most horrifying sound of all. Silence. The cold rush blasted me in the face, blinding me for a second. When I opened my eyes, I could see the shining red blood dripping off of what looked like two fangs. I could sense my life was at an end. At peace with this, I closed my eyes and waiting for death\u2019s embrace. Nothing but a faint light behind my eyelids. I opened my eyes, taken aback. There, in front of me, lay the writhing body of Count Chocula. The sunlight filled more and more of the arena, as the ancient vampire\u2019s body poured smoke and screams into the air. As the last bit of him disintegrated, I looked up and saw the devastation he had wrought. All of the survivors from the initial brawl were unrecognizable, the vampire having mangled and consumed their very beings. Now I stand, victorious. My brother have not died in vain. I bathe in the sun for a few moments, taking in its life giving rays. I begin to walk out but the arena feels as if it has gotten hotter. Each step becomes more arduous than the last. Is the sun getting closer? I\u2019m sweating through my socks and shoes, leaving behind little puddles. Wait, is that sweat or is it my rubber\u2026 I look up. The sun is filling the sky completely now. It seems to continue to get closer, as if it\u2019s following me. My god, it\u2019s hot. I can barely stand. Is the sun holding scoops? A raisin falls to the ground next to me.",

If bam bam goes for a punch it would have to be on the front legs as everything else leaves him having been hit by the claws and if bam bam hits 1 tony can still hit with the other.

A tank of fresh, cold, good milk is one of my favourite smells. It reminds me of raspberries and whipping cream; it's a sweet smell. ",

She was unhurt except for a cut on her leg, but obviously I panicked and leaned on a glass-covered suitcase in my haste to get to her. A tiny sliver of glass pierced my finger. The EMT who arrived on the scene looked at it and told me there was nothing in the cut. Two weeks later, it still hurt like hell when I pressed on it, so we went to the hospital. The doctor number my finger and dug around in it with a syringe for about 10 minutes before he finally pulled out a tiny crescent of glass. I have nerve damage in my finger. ",

Sad to say, but my first thought was someone was shooting at me or shooting at the kids walking across the field to the cars waiting. I didn't see anyone running or looking around so I figured no one was shooting. I called a glass place to fix it and found out that this isn't uncommon. I guess the rear window defroster shorts and creates a hot spot in the glass or there is a defect in the glass and the window blows out.

At the end of the night, my two girlfriends and I head back to the car and realize the passenger side window was smashed in. That's when we found the brick in the car. And that's also when we realized my moms wallet that she had in her center console was gone. We had to drive an hour home in January in 15 degree weather with no window and glass shards occasionally blowing back at us. My mom was rocking the trash bag on her window for about a week after that. Sorry mom. ",

Just last Wednesday my car's only door lock cylinder broke - the spring gave out so my key spun freely in the cylinder like a clock with broken hands. My key fob has needed recoding and was inside my car since I had plans to drop it off the next day at my buddies shop, so I've been using the manual key for the last month. So I call AAA @9 pm to use a bladder and rod kit. Since my car was parked in a parking garage, on an incline between the 2nd and 3rd levels, it didn't take long for my alarm to go off several times while attempting to pull the door handles on both sides, as well as trying for the unlock button below my stick shift. After almost an hour, the friendly AAA guys call it a day. My girlfriend picks me up and we go home. Overnight I scour the BMW forums I'm on and Google different \"secrets\" of gaining access. Next morning I call AAA again to try the bladder and rod but this time my goal is to hit the trunk release which didn't work out. So they call me a locksmith. 3 hours with the locksmith consisted of slim jimming all 4 doors, pulling on inside handles again, eventually busting out part of my tail light to try and access the rear hatch cable which didn't work either (it's possible if you know what you're looking for). I finally decided to use his 5lb sledgehammer to bust out the rear door window. 5 solid swings and the hammer hardly leaves a scratch! So after leaving my car in even worse condition, the locksmith wished me luck and didn't charge me a dime. So I go to the hardware store and buy a sledgehammer built for the apocalypse and a center punch, and even that method took several swings - I do go to the gym 5x a week so I'm shocked that safety glass is so strong. So if you saw a guy driving a BMW X5 with no door lock, no rear door window, and 1/4 of my tail light assembly missing, that was me. Thank goodness I'm a solid backyard mechanic or I'd be selling Big Blue!",

I came home to my apartment to recover to find out that the apartment above me was having their carpet and subflooring completely replaced because the previous tenants had 8 children and that is too many for keeping your apartment floor alright. Work was scheduled so hammertime all day long continued. By the time the evening rolled around I got super sick from the anesthesia wearing off and went to bed. Was roused about 20 minutes later by a lot of loud banging on my apartment door. It was the police. Some drunk pair of assholes wandered up and down my street (I live in a not so good area of town) and threw full Coors glass bottle through my rear driver's side window as hard as they could (most of the bottle ended up on my dash and there are glass shards and cheap beer over every seat in my car). Using the same method they also smashed in someone else's car window, and two other people's windshields. Didn't steal anything. When the officer brought me out to the car I looked down the street and several other officers had arms full of unopened tall boys that the two assholes had trailed down the street like Hansel and Gretel. (At the Grand Jury I went to regarding the case one of the cops said he slammed a couple later in the parking lot \"spoils of war\" - presumably after his shift, haha.) Apparently after all the window smashing these guys then went to a convenience store and tried to jump some dude who was getting a few groceries. Dude haymakered the main instigator right in the face with a full gallon of milk and ran in to the store where police were called and they were arrested. Sheriff said he would try to get me a copy of the security footage of that happening just so I can delight in it. I really hope he pulls through! EDITED for typos. ALSO: a previous time this happened someone smashed out my two rear small windows (drivers and passenger's sides) and tore my rear passenger door apart so they could steal stuff. I don't leave anything in my car because I used to live in a city where there was a lot of that kind of theft. The suck part was that my doors were unlocked! But they were frozen shut because it was January in fucking North Dakota where I was living for a little bit and you needed to really pull on them to get them to open so the thief just assumed they were locked.",

One morning I go out to the driveway and find the passenger rear window broken and a bowling ball lying on the ground by the car. The car had tinting, so the window is broken, but held together by the tinting. It also was nicely dented inward from the bowling ball. I open the door and there are muddy footprints on the ceiling of the cabin. There appears to be a muddy footprint on the dash also. The center console is open, as is the glove box. The front passenger door is cracked open. It seems the idiot broke the window to gain access, crawled into the back seat, over the console to the front and exited the car through the front passenger door. There was no change in the car and I had left the car unlocked to prevent idiots from breaking the windows for this very reason. But, no. The idiot needed to break the glass before even testing the door handles. I was able to source a replacement glass with tinting no less from a local junkyard. But for a few days, I drove around with clear plastic over that window. A month later, some idiot broke the rear quarter pane on the other side to gain access to the car. The car was unlocked then, too. Still no money left in the car. I sourced that piece of glass from the same junked vehicle. Again, I drove around for a few days with plastic in place of the window.

It was pretty solid so I left it like that for some months. The car died and I had it parked out front for a month or two until I could afford to get it fixed, and a new window. Some one cut a hole in the plastic just big enough to get a slim jim in (why not just rip it off?) and stole a pair of fake Oakley sunglasses. They tried to steal my change in the ash tray but it only had cigarette ash and they left finger marks in it. Then they tried to jam a screw driver in the ignition to steal it (maybe that's why they didn't trash the window covering!) but couldn't and left my poor car in even worse shape. I fixed it up and drove it for a few more years then the timing chain died, wrecked the motor. I gave it to a guy at a shop just so I didn't have to deal with it anymore. Not bad for a $300 car I bought not running, got it running and it lasted me 5 years. I still chuckle when I think about that handful of ash. Asshats. ",

Window luckily wasn't broken. 3rd time: Christmas Eve. Dug all up through my shit. Thought they got something when they found an old iPhone box. They accidentally popped the hood looking for the trunk pop. That gesture made me feel like it was the same guy as before. I initially thought they didn't get anything but they stole an old credit card that was deactivated because the bank had sent one with a chip. This dumb motherfucker tried to use it FOUR times. He went to CVS and tried it twice, when that didn't work he went to an ATM to use it (because you have my pin???), waited 12 hours and tried to use it at a liquor store. I'm gonna throw in a fourth time because I'm also pretty sure a homeless person slept in my car after the guy broke in on Christmas Eve. I unfortunately didn't know it was broken into for three days because I parked it and was just hanging out with my friend.",

Had to go out one night, and drive 20 miles to a court-ordered class I was attending, and when I unlocked the car, I heard a metal tinkling sound from the door. Thought nothing of it. Did the class, it started snowing and blowing and was freeeeeeeeezing when I got done, and I couldn't get back in the car. The courthouse also held the county jail so I went and asked if they could radio a squad to come help me out and he did. Someone had knocked the pins out of the door handles trying to pick their way into my car. We owned the car another year or so, and we always had to leave a back door open so I could climb in, open my door from the back seat, and then let my wife in. All over nothing, if they'd been successful they wouldn't have taken anything probably",

He even would pop the faceplate off his stereo and take it with him. Nothing in the car basically and doors unlocked and someone cuts right through it AGAIN. There was nothing really for them to steal so they attempted to rip the stereo out of the dashboard and I guess they couldn't get it out all the way so they tore his dashboard up in several places trying to pull it out and I guess decided fuck it and they just left it hanging halfway out of the dashboard.

The place was hot garbage. No insulation in the roof, windows were all single pane, and we had rats-- lots of rats. Since it was an old fucking house, though, almost every piece of it was an antique, including the front door. Made from old growth redwood, the door was literally, and yes I mean literally, worth more than any item in the home. It was a solid bit of wood. We lived next to the busiest street in the city and with it shut we couldn't hear a damned thing. When we closed it, it made the house shake. Anyway, we figured that any bum trying to break in would damage the door. That'd be a crying a shame. That door lived through two world wars and a depression, and getting torn apart by an addict with a crowbar seems like a real shitty way to end a career. ",

I put a slip yoke eliminator kit on the NP231 and had a custom rear drive shaft made up from a Ford Explorer drive shaft. It's major weak spot was that the engine ran hot while crawling slow in the boondocks, and the rear differential (3:73) was the weak-ass Dana 35. The front diff was a Dana 30--much stronger than the D35. I wanted to replace the D35 with a Ford 8.8 on the rear, gear down the differential to 4:10 and install a rear locker. I had to move though, and with no place to keep it, I sold it to a friend cheap. It needed to live in the country anyway. I would never buy a new model Jeep.

A pretty common trope is that one character will activate a fire alarm pull station, setting off the sprinklers throughout the building, in order to get out of class, work, etc. Pulling the fire alarm will NEVER set off the sprinklers. The sprinkler system works like this: The sprinkler pipes are filled with water when the system is installed. There is a pump on the system, which keeps the water in the pipes constantly under pressure. The sprinkler heads are just an opening in the pipe and a small, star-shaped plate which causes the water to spray in all directions. There is a glass tube which plugs the opening in the sprinkler head. The glass tube is filled with a liquid which expands a lot when heated. When the glass tube is heated enough, the liquid expands to the point where it shatters the glass. With the glass broken, it can no longer plug the opening in the sprinkler head. The water then sprays out. The only way more than one head can activate at a time is if they are all heated enough to allow liquid to shatter the glass plug in each. Pulling a fire alarm station will set off the fire alarm throughout the building, but it will not set off sprinklers. Source: I install fire alarm systems.",

At the library I work at, the librarians rotate time at the reference desk). Librarians at a college library will be assisting with research, conducting research of their own, running a class to teach bored undergrads how to use this, that, or the other database, as well as some of the above tasks, like managing purchases or (more usually) managing licensing, or budgeting. A librarian at a museum or archive might be trying to figure out how to digitize a rare book without destroying it or how to best catalog a map.

Hollywood portrays US healthcare about love and patient care, even though US healthcare is centered around squeezing the most money out of those that have insurances.

That scanning with MRI or CT will always result in a correct diagnosis. 11. That most of patients are young and healthy except for that dramatic seizure or sickness. Most patients in real life are old to very old and are smokers/overweight etcetera. The young and healthy ones with suddne diseases are a rare sighting 12. That every doctor has all the time in the world 13. Comas are very common and people wake up from it all the time with no consequences. 14. That life in hospital is not monotonous.",

Trip routing and planning. Coordinating with driver managers and load planners. Drivers (we call ourselves drivers not truckers) don't eat at diners or restaurants daily, and most keep food in the truck. Many even have small fridges and stoves. Nobody sleeps in a motel unless their truck is broken down. It's very rare that a movie or tv show actually shows the sleeper berth of a truck, and my friends and family are often surprised when they find out I only sleep in the truck. Picking up a hitchhiker or hooker is grounds for termination if you're a company driver, and pretty much every driver I've ever met is disgusted by prostitution. Thankfully there's only a few truck stops in the country where you'll find prostitution and they are easily avoided. There are some older guys still out there driving but they are all mostly very gentlemanly mid western farmer or southern types. There's a fair amount of middle aged dude bros who have a wife and kids and are into football and beer, like any blue collar non trucker type. There's also been a huge influx of younger guys who spend their free time derping around on Reddit while watching anime or playing video games in their truck. Guess which on I am lol. ",

I had a top taliban commander and his lieutenants under my crosshairs for a couple hours once and the pilot and I ran at least a dozen practice runs just in case we were asked to shoot. Never happened. People with a lot more rank decided it was more beneficial to keep tabs on them all and gather more Intel. Another time I watched the taliban launch mortars at another village because they refused to pay their protection money. Pilot and I were seconds away from putting a missile on the mortar tube and 3 guys when they grabbed the tube,dashed 10meters and threw it in the tree line and split 2 different directions. Turned out the goddamn Army helos got to close despite the JTAC (Joint Terminal Air Controller, guy on ground who gives us the go ahead to fire in this instance) telling them to stay the fuck away. Taliban fuckers heard the rotors of the helicopter and ran into a nearby village they weren't shooting at. I tried to follow but it happened so fast they were lost in the populace. 90% of the job was sheer boredom. Running checklists, operations checks, practicing attack scenarios. Scanning routes for IED'S, defensive firing positions, and choke points, and the worst thing of all: watching a \"compound\" for hours for patterns of life especially at night. The most exciting thing you might see is what I call a DVST... Darth Vader Shit Taker. In black hot infrared, a male will exit his mud house looking like Darth Vader with his man dress on, walk to a point in his walled in yard, squat, and leave a shit glowing black against the cooler white background in infrared. I have seen more of this than anyone should but that won't make it into an episode of Homeland, NCIS or into a Bourne movie. ISIS was the only thing the made the job interesting. I flew missions in the early days of us fighting against them, first just to gather Intel, then to actually attack. Take that 90% I mentioned before and reverse it. 90% awesome missions doing great work and 10% boredom of transiting across empty desert back to base. This is one of my alternate accounts different from my main so it may be one of the first posts on it but I thought the name fit for this response. ",

How rent is paid at the decadent office shall remain a mystery for the moment apparently. So the super-lawyer meets with the client and it becomes immediately apparent that they're a crazy person who has no entitlement either in fact or in law for the relief they're seeking. But that's ok, super-lawyer's on the case and they arrange a jury trial starting the very next day! Court doesn't look like it's going so well at first as all of the facts are against them and, again, there's no basis in law to support any aspect of the case but just when all hope is lost it's time for closing arguments. This is where super-lawyer really earns her money (if she were getting paid, but as we all know she's not) as closing arguments are where you get to disregard everything that's happened so far and wave your hands around making ridiculous emotive arguments with weird analogies that don't relate to anything. The jury eats it up and awards 18 billion dollars in damages! Good job super-lawyer! Yeah...I can't watch any tv show about lawyers anymore. ",

So they're really eager to work hard to publish a good book, which would be impossible given the stereotype you note. Plus, people don't realize that most contracts between authors and publishers lay out timelines by which a draft of the manuscript must be deliverable; and depending on the author's negotiations, his/her advance can be split up to be delivered upon the differing stages of the editable manuscripts. So it's not like all authors receive their large advances straight up on signing, and then the authors are free to drink, do drugs, be miserable, etc. or else they'll literally have no money. ",

The judge did not say a word or bat an eye, he pointed at one of his bailiffs, pointed at the defendant, and pointed at the ground below his bench.

You do that with chest compressions on the heart. This priority is the same for Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA), when the heart is beating in the proper way but not putting forth any pressure (and blood circulation). Chest compressions are a manual way to restore circulation until the heart returns to nominal function. Shocking is for when the chambers of the heart are squeezing out of order, in a manner that is useless or harmful. When it's squeezing out of order, it's generally because it's caught in a feedback loop of electrical activity. The shock jolts all that shit and (hopefully) resets it back to the normal sequence. Drugs, like atropine are meant to help the heart squeeze more efficiently when it's crappy. Drugs like epinephrine tighten all the arteries and make the heart double time. Chest compressions are the only way to get these drugs to circulate around the body and to the heart in order to work. Otherwise, you will just inject it and it will go nowhere. In some cases, you can even mix it up and water and shoot it into the lungs (not preferred)! Source: CVICU nurse",

Some kinds of modern video formats don't actually work by recording every frame as an individual picture- Rather, they work by telling you what the difference between the next frame and the current frame is. This saves a lot of space, because even in modern movies the difference between one frame and the next can just be somebody blinking or an eye moving- not a lot to record. In these types of formats, the most common glitch is when one of the differences is missed. The next frame just grabs what it's supposed to and moves it over, resulting in weird blurs and ghosting. This stuff usually fixes itself on a \"scene\" change simply because at that point the whole image is reset. Someone who is more familiar with video encoding can probably go in more depth- I only know so much because I do encoding of my own disks for convenience's sake and like to learn a bit as I go along. You fix it in 30 seconds with Holywood magic... Or by doing nothing at all and it resolves itself like I said above.",

We have the suspect on good quality video. The video is good enough we can see his tattoos clearly. The camera in the parking lot (also good) got his license plate. He bragged to his girlfriend about the robbery. He cheated on his girlfriend, who told the police about it. He posted a picture with him, the gun and the money on Facebook. Police found the gun when they ran the warrant. When I say slam dunk, it's not one or two of those, it could easily be all of the above. ",

In Gracepoint, they are pretty much model types (especially Tennant's partner from the police), and the story is much poorer for it. Together with the way the dialogues are presented, it feels about as real as your average episode of Castle, while in Broadchurch it felt like all of it may be happening to people you personally know, to the point where it was very hard to watch at times.

Person is stripped naked, and 6 or so people are working around, pounding on the chest and bagging them, which forces air through their vocal cords so you can sometimes hear what sounds like moaning even though they're dead. Long IV lines are being inserted into the groin, IV pressure bags are being hung, a tube is being forced down the trachea, and you can hear the sounds of ribs cracking, and no, that's not malpractice, that's CPR. And then, once there is nothing more that can be done which occurs in the majority of these cases, practitioners stop all interventions and make sure their documentation is correct. No one is having a melt down about how they couldn't save the patient, as most of these people never even met the patient. And the bed is littered with medical trash and wrappers and blood from where the lines were inserted. And everyone leaves.

Probably akin to why so many soldiers pick up smoking on deployments. Constants stress, and then its suddenly gone, and you need something to spark the pleasure centers in your brain since you've been running at full speed for hours straight. Cigarettes, booze and drugs do this well, and the time frame for most wholesome activities have passed by the time your shift is over. Also, the job almost accommodates addictions, many places have an attitude of \"as long as you arent fucked up or too hungover to get the job done and you show up, we dont care\" That way good ol grill cook jimmy can finish a bottle of bourbon each night, sleep it off, then get up just in time for work at 3. On a side note. I've dealt with some old school italian guys who just love yelling. They remind me of the dad who never told you they love you. E.g. morning guy gets off and already helped clear a ton of dishes 30 minutes ago, hes done his dues for the day. Chef just loses it \"you fucking piece of shit this is a fucking team get your head out of your selfish ass or next time ill throw you in the fuckin pizza oven\" Then he leaves and chef says \" I know he does lots of dishes, hes actually a pretty hard worker\" There are nice chefs, and sober enough kitchens, but many fit the stereotype to some degree, at least during a busy period.

I go downstairs to look for some sort of shut off valve since all manner of expensive computers are in danger of being ruined. So here I am cranking away at various valves, shouting orders. Suddenly the hvac ductwork, which had filled with water, gave way. Collapsing all over an electrical panel. So now I'm outta there. Ain't nobody got time for flooded basement and wet mains.

The basic plot of the movie is that women in bikinis do things in or on the water in pairs, and the shark eats them both. Rinse. Repeat. Like, it starts with *two* people waterskiing behind a boat. Also at some point there's a boat that gets in trouble and starts sinking and they have to go on and island and then some things happen and the shark eats them. So, anyway, when they're first exploring the island, they come across a huge hole in the island. Like, a big pit that's maybe 10 feet across. And there's this whole mini-scene where they look at the hole, don't know what it is, and move on. And I'm thinking, ok, sweet: foreshadowing. Sometime later, they're going to be running from the shark and someone's going to fall in the hole. Or even the hole is connected to some underwater tunnels, and the shark is going to *come out of the hole and eat people*. And then it's never mentioned again in the whole movie. It's a *literal* plot hole. So, to answer the OP: About 10 feet across. The entire movie is on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4Pi2Yn8Ih4) and finding the hole is 15 minutes in. Probably NSFW due to boobs. ETA: OMFG there is a 3-Headed Shark Attack sequel!",

But then in the end it turns out he is the real Santa and Santa does in fact exist as he somehow proves it. All good so far. However the part that gets me is on the parents side. They didn't believe he was Santa because he's fictional. But their kid was getting presents for years. Which they would have to be buying. But did they not wonder where the extra presents were coming from? You know the ones that the actual Santa who has always existed unbeknownst to them has been delivering each Christmas. Realistically no parent would believe in him and would buy the toys. So every parent must be wondering where the extra presents came from. And even if by some logic Santa didn't deliver to kids in those situations. He wouldn't be delivering any toys as every kid would be in a household where the parents by the toys. And even if it was only some households. Are parents entitled to some reimbursements for the money they've been spending on toys over all the years when Santa should have been delivering them for free? ",

It's uncommon, but it's not rare. The blood bank would have some, and if they didn't (for some reason) they could get it from a neighboring hospital or blood service. Secondly, they wouldn't need to get AB- anyway. Because if Dexter is AB- and they don't have any of that, he can still get a-, b-, and o-.. which once again, his hospital's blood bank would have. EDIT: to everyone saying that AB- is the rarest blood type. You are wrong. *AB- is the rarest ABO type.* Not a rare blood type. I know you think you're a special snowflake, but you're not. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE. I wouldn't wish a rare type oh my worst enemy.

Then, when he goes back in time to stab himself in his hands, he goes back to the time when he is in the art class as a child, and when his teacher tells him to set down and continue working, he kind of pauses to think about it, then sits down and draws the same picture as before. What I don't get is why did he draw that picture of him killing the two skinheads when even his adult self hadn't done that yet? I thought that maybe the scene was there to imply that Evan was somehow just detached from time and he was able to see multiple outcomes via his blackouts but it is still kind of confusing. ",

You can argue and persuade and cajole all you want, but Buzz can incorporate any environmental stimuli into his worldview because his reality stems from a carefully manufactured self image.

His sister Monica is described as \"freakishly strong\" and is likely able to at least match Ross in any contest of physical prowess, such as when they played football on thanksgiving for the Geller cup. Joey is definitely stronger than Ross, as even when Ross was at his strongest, \"Red Ross\", Joey was easily able to shove Ross away when he asked for Joey's muffin. Phoebe may be the most learned fighter of the group, having grown up on the streets. In their youth, Phoebe was even able to mug Ross, albeit a pasty-faced scrawny teenage Ross. Chandler and Ross are equally matched, as shown in the episode where they arm-wrestled at the Halloween party. And if anything, Rachel would eat Ross, as the more aggressive and domineering female of their relationship.",

What you don't know is that diffuse sunlight -- like the kind you have indoors during the daytime -- also hurts them, just to a much lesser extent. It keeps them sluggish and docile -- that's why Gizmo is so lazy. >See, Mogwais are the immature form. After puberty, a wild Mogwai naturally becomes a Gremlin. To prevent pet Mogwais from transforming, you need to keep them weakened somehow. When sunlight has weakened them, you can feed them. But when it's been dark a few hours, they recover from the sun damage, and now you have to keep them weak with hunger. If they're fed but weakened by the sun, they're fine; if they've recovered from the sun but they're still hungry, they're fine. But when they're fed AND they've had time to recover from sun damage? That's when they have the energy to metamorphosise and then you're in trouble. >Laymen often ask \"But it's ALWAYS after midnight, when can you start feeding them again?!\" The answer is, \"When the sun comes up.\" Because once it's sunny again, they'll be too lethargic to transform, no matter how well-fed they are. >If you're interested in learning more, my new 6000-page book on Mogwai physiology and pathology should be coming out in November from Harper-Collins, once I clear up this psych eval and these copyright infringement lawsuits some guy called Universal Studios keeps throwing at me.

Basically, the mogwai's were either weakened by sunlight or their natural circadian rhythm made them very dormant during normal daylight hours. This meant you could feed them all you wanted because the energy gain they were given was not enough to transform during normal daylight hours. However, during the night-time - they were either no longer weakened by sunlight or their metabolism would greatly increase at this time - so if fed - that energy in combination with their non weakened/heightened metabolism state allowed them to transform into the gremlin form.

Either way the real question is why didn't she just convince Kuzco to stand over the trap door and get devoured by crocodiles instead of the complicated poison plot. Well since she herself has fallen and survived, it can be assumed that she tested it on some other victim and they too survived, meaning the trap-door was not as lethal as she predicted and in fact a failed experiment, one in which she has been procrastinating deactivating. Hence the line \"Why do we even have that lever?\" She's implying why does she even STILL have that lever. She's beating herself up over her stupidity of not getting rid of it sooner. Or it's just a Disney movie with a cartoon gag that was never meant to handle the plot analyzing of a grown man at 1:30 in the morning, but imma go with the whole failed-trap-door thing.

The first season tried, but they focused too hard on the kazon. who in theory worked, but were not competent enough to be a worthy villain. They were just the assigned bad guy who was bad. The Maquis storyline resolved way too quickly, as they reverted to starfleet ways way to fast. [The episode with Prometheus shows what voyager could have been. or the year of hell saga](/spoiler) It was a wasted opportunity, but I still like it for what it was, and it did have its moments. I want a lost in space star trek series to happen. Maybe something with red squad getting lost on an expedition into unknown regions of space, and rather than a large cast of assumed disposable crew members like voyager had to kill off, a small surviving cast on a vast ship that is massively damaged, and the people who know how to operate and maintain it are dead or dieing. A series of cadets, would be amazing and could recapture some of the glory, without just being another rehash of voyager. ",

He's great against the army of CGI kiss-mutated cops but how much good are bullets against gods? We didn't get enough information on Killer Croc's abilities for me to explain why he's useless but he didn't do anything until there was explicitly something that involved going under water and they didn't even think to have him do it, he volunteered. Slipknot can climb things. They had such little faith in him that he wasn't even in the initial proposal. Katana would be useful if ancient gods have souls. I'm not sure what any of the implications of that would be though. Flag is literally there to keep the bad guys in line and because he doesn't want the woman possessed by the goddess to die. He's more of a liability than anything else. If there's anyone else, I forgot about them and you probably did too. TL;DR They're all fucking useless, especially on paper.",

Have you ever spent any time around bored deployed soldiers? When they run out of stuff to do and there's sand that needs guarding, they will come up with some extremely creative and entirely disgusting things to entertain themselves. In Afghanistan I knew a guy who hosted camel spider fights and ran book on them, and he made like $500 before he got caught. I have no problem believing that 2 stormtroopers found some space worm in a hole somewhere and decided to bring it back to the Death Star and keep it as a pet. They probably got away with it for a week or 2 before some butterbar imperial lieutenant caught them and made them flush it. ",

In their hubris they allowed themselves to believe that the light side was the natural way the force was supposed to be. To the Clone Wars era Jedi, the dark side of the force is a perversion of the light side, not a perversion of the force itself. There is a brilliant moment in Revenge of the Sith that is often overlooked by most people, that I feel explains the corruption of the Jedi. So when Count Dooku was at the mercy of Anakin near the beginning of the film, he feels that it isn't the Jedi way to execute disarmed prisoners. To which Palpatine says: \"He's too dangerous to be left alive.\" Then Anakin kills him. Fast forward to the moment when Mace Windu is dueling Palpatine, who is now identified as the Dark Lord Sidious thanks to Anakin. Here we get a really telling moment of the Jedi mentality and Palpatine's unexpected brilliance. Mace Windu tells Anakin that Palpatine \"Is too dangerous to be left alive.\" Now imagine you're Anakin. The second in command of the Jedi order just said the EXACT same thing as the Dark Lord of the Sith, who is supposed to be the most evil guy in the galaxy. From Anakin's point of view it is the Jedi who are evil, because how can Palpatine be \"evil\" and Mace Windu who is \"good\", if both parties are preaching the exact same thing.",

The Bolton's have submitted to Lannister rule (that was the whole point of the Red Wedding), and so would obey and recognise that marriage. As far as everyone is concerned, Sansa is married to Tyrion and so cannot marry Ramsey. Perhaps people might poke holes in my explanation, but there are loads of plot holes with regards to travel. Littlefinger turning up at the end of the battle of the bastards would have involved him going through Moat Cailin, which famously cannot be taken from the south and was under command of Bolton's forces. In fact, him getting between the Vale and the North as he does is a massive hole. Asha (or Yara) travelling from the Iron Islands to the Dreadfort by sea would have meant her going right the way around the whole of Westeros for what was a five minute thing of Theon/Reek going \"no I can't go back\" for Asha/Yara to sail all the way back to the Iron Islands. A one way journey there would have taken way over a year (I think). EDIT: Thought I'd add another seeing as this got a lot of traction. Ellaria Sand and her three sand snakes taking over Dorne is complete bullshit. She's a bastard as so has no claim on anything, and even if she were to try and claim it by right of conquest, she'd have every single House of Dorne rebelling against her. She simply cannot control Dorne. ",

Joker didn't even aim higher up than a single city, and created more tension because we're invested in Batman and Harvey to a lesser extent, and they theoretically could still lose and have to stop the Joker do his thing in another city or do damage control.

It would call a lot into question for the hero, are they always in the right, is always doing the right the thing the right thing to do, can you do evil in the name of good or can you never compromise your principles?

It's explained in more detail in the comic book that part of the story line is based on but they do explain this whole point starting from Batman Begins. The Comic: In the comic book when Gotham fell there was a behavioral shift among the people. Things became so dire that no one feared Batman or much of anything else. The entire city was divided between gangs and they marked their territory with tags. Even what was left of the police force had to operate as a gang. When Batman returned to Gotham he noted that in order for him to take charge again he had to adapt and speak their 'language' in order for him to climb back up the foodchain and establish himself as the alpha predator in a sense. Every time he took down a gang or cleared a street he would tag the whole block and criminals stayed away. The Movie: The Batman is meant to be a symbol, not just a man. He is basically working under an ideology, an idea that is bigger than the criminals that he is facing. They establish this point in Batman Begins. he actually says this explicitly to Alfred. Early into TDKR you'll notice that little kids were drawing graffiti with the bat symbol. This was an homage to the comic book. He had been gone for years but they believed that the new era of Gotham was because of him. When Batman returned hit lit up a big ass symbol that you could see for miles which was for the criminals and the citizens alike. ",

Suddenly someone else jumps out and stabs the target and cause ensues, we follow the would be attacker as they slip down an alleyway and it is revealed to be the waif in disguise. The camera cuts back to a shot of the stabbed victim as it is revealed they were not actually Arya, and that they were simply the victim of a totally uninvolved killing, camera cuts to another character who had featured prominently but not as the focus in many of the stalking scenes as they slip away, they go out of sight for a moment and Arya steps out from where they should have emerged. I'm not a very good writer at all but that's how I imagined the chase scene should have been, lots of confusion about who is who, but lots of wide and overhead shots so that the viewer can understand who is moving where etc. ",

The studio worried that it wasn't marketable enough (they wanted a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio as The Riddler). Nolan's original draft had Bane as someone who was both physically stronger than Batman and also just as intelligent if not outright smarter, who had the primary goal of humiliating Batman. He didn't have any particular villain in mind so the studio decided that Bane was the best fit, Nolan didn't know who the character was. Warner Bros called for a ton of changes and Goyer did most of them and wrote pretty much the first half of the movie (including the often quoted airplane scene) and then Goyer left and Jonathon Nolan filled in the rest, except for the very ending of the movie (Batman faking his own death to retire) which Goyer and the Nolan brothers had planned since they made Batman Begins.
