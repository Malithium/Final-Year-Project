Sorry for any confusion.\n\nEDIT 2 - The first two *are* verbatim. Third one actually looks like this:\n\n> \"When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending the best. They\u2019re not sending you, they\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bring crime. They\u2019re rapists\u2026 And some, I assume, are good people.\"",

So we didn't really have a plan in case of bushfire- which, if you live in a fire-prone area, for the love of God make one. So we weren't listening to the radio, we weren't packed to go, we didn't have an escape plan. \n\nThe 'oh, this is real' moment was when I was standing on the top of a hill, overlooking the paddocks, the sky was black and orange and in the distance I could see this line of orange. And I went 'oh, that's pretty close.' \n\nThen we just started hosing everything down, because it was too late to run. The fire got within five-ten minutes of us, my friend's property was partially burnt, went up to their shed before the wind changed. ",

Saw a shitload of emergency vehicles pass by from the city next door. Tried to call my family - no reception. Texted my mom \"Hey, you guys didn't die in a tornado, did you?\" No response.  \n\nThen, ten minutes later, FWAM. My phone starts lighting up with texts. With pictures. With news. I wanted to drive to my parents, maybe see what I could do to help, but my in laws insisted we stay with them. They didn't want us anywhere near the damage. My sisters, who were closer to the area where it hit, went out looking for people until emergency crews came on the scene. The shit they were texting - they dug out some seriously damaged people. Some dead people. My dad called a few hours later - told me he was called to work to assess damage at his plant, and to hunt for some missing guys. He found them - drowned in a pipe outside, caught by the weather.  \n\nAll of this, ALL of it, seemed unreal. Like it wasn't really happening. It wasn't until the next day, when my in laws finally relented and let my then husband and I go into town so I could see my folks, that the reality smacked me. The damage...it was fucking unreal. A town I graduated high school and college in, just ... split in two, the center a jumble of lumber and debris. It looked like a flattened garbage dump. Every landmark, gone. And then there was the bizarre shit, the shit that showed how strong the winds were - metal siding wrapped around poles, semi trucks at a trucking facility knocked over like dominoes on one side of the lot, and on the other tossed around like shit was thrown from a kid's toy chest. Cars on top of other cars. Debris jammed through surviving walls. An apartment building that looked like someone took a knife to it and sliced it in half.  \n\nTHAT is the shit that made it real. And even now, though I have the memories, and I can see pictures online, and the streets look vastly different from before the storm, it still doesn't seem quite like it happened.

The scariest part about them is how quickly they build up; you have 3-4 days of worrying, and then suddenly at 3am your parents pull you out of bed and order you to pack because of the mandatory evacuation.  So that was always the first \"oh shit\"--scrambling into a cramped car in the dead of night, with just your vital documents and as much food and emergency supplies as you can fit, not knowing what will happen.\n\nSecond oh shit: Evacuating.  Even at 3am, millions of people are evacuating, and that's millions of cars backed up on every single road.  You can't waste gas on air conditioning, so it's boiling hot and cramped in the dead of a Texas summer.  You'd move maybe ten feet in an hour.  The roads were so clogged that I remember people getting out of their cars and playing Frisbee on the interstate.  If you're close to the hurricane, it's even more terrifying, it sounds like the sky is getting ripped open.  We were lucky to have family to stay with, but that doesn't stop the destruction.  I remember watching CNN when Ike made landfall, realizing the flooded area and collapsed buildings looked familiar, and asking my mom, \"Wait--isn't that our neighborhood?\"  You never want to see your house on CNN.\n\nThird oh shit: Coming back.  It always looks like those post-apocalyptic movies: houses ripped apart, streets flooded, trees torn out of the ground or splitting open buildings.  Most of the dead are in their houses, but sometimes the bodies were washed into the rivers and streets.  (BTW--graves float upwards in floods.  The cemeteries were always torn apart, with caskets and corpses thrown everywhere and rotting in the wet sun.)  \n\nAfter Rita, because we were too poor to evacuate, we lived at home for a short while.  No electricity besides the generator, no running water, no emergency services, living off MREs and boiled street water.  Wild hogs and alligators prowled everywhere (chased out of their usual homes by the storm), and I remember playing in the huge felled trees in the streets.  Lots of people kept watch with guns to chase off looters.  It felt like living in a zombie movie.  Eventually FEMA would show up, and you'd wait in line forever for your ration of bottled water and MREs while they tried to reconstruct everything.  So that was the third oh shit--trying to figure out how you move on from there, after your area has been torn to shreds.\n\n[It was odd growing up and realizing not all kids understood the FEMA markings for how many bodies were found in a house.](http://imgur.com/a/4SZ9m)  I know that should have been obvious, but FEMA was such a normal part of my childhood that it never occurred to me.",

We had a giant hole in our home for a while until it could be fixed.\n\nThe second time was when flooding hit Texas.  Normally we never had a problem, but Mom got increasingly nervous because the water was rising fast.  Then they called for us to evacuate.  People in the surrounding areas were being airlifted out.  When we drove down the little dirt road to survey the main road we were met with what looked like an ocean.  We lived up on a hill, and all of the graze land surrounding our home was just water.\n\nI was like 15 at the time, and was utterly terrified.  We went down the main road, and found it blocked.  We went up towards town, and that was flooded, too.  My Mom was in tears, because she thought we were going to be trapped.  Then I remembered that one of the lonely backroads connects to a maze of dirt roads that eventually hits the highway.  With my uncle leading the way, we followed him out.

Then it rained some more, got more powerful, and didn't stop for days.  There was talk that the local rivers were going to crest and cause some pretty serious flooding.  We lived somewhat close to the Amite River, but our neighbors said our neighborhood hadn't flood in over 100 years.\n\nLocal news said that the near by high school may get a little bit of water inside from the rising river.  We thought we had a couple of days to plan on how we were going to shelter in place because of the weather forecast.\n\nOn the 13th of August, I woke up, walked outside and starting walking toward the direction of the river.  Some of the lower areas were collecting water but there was no standing water anywhere near my house or even my neighborhood.  I went back home and told my wife we should probably get some supplies in case this got serious.  Maybe we should even pack a car in case we need to leave, but I'm sure there will be nothing to worry about.\n\nAbout 30 minutes into slowly packing there is a loud banging on my front door.  It's my wife's cousin.  I open the door and she says, \"What are you doing?!  Get out of the house!\"  I look behind her and my entire yard is under water and the water line is only about a half inch front going over my doorstep and into my house.\n\nI was floored.  The river wasn't supposed to crest until the next day.  I thought we had more time.\n\nI yelled at my wife, \"We have to get out of the house.  Now!\"\n\nWe packed up both our cars in about 10 minutes with only our most precious memories.  Everything else we had built in a 10 year marriage was left behind.  We evacuated about 5 miles east away from the river to my wife's grandmothers.\n\nAfter being there for about an hour someone comes to the front door and says, \"You guys need to get out.  The river is coming.\"\n\nSure enough, her yard was flooding.\n\nWe evacuated a second time in as many hours to her cousins house even further east.  After only an hour we were told again that the river was on the way and we had to leave.\n\nWe evacuated three times that day.  I drove back through the flooded waters at some point because we left our cat.  When I got back to our house I sloshed through knee deep water filled with trash and our water logged belongings.  Got the cat safely though.\n\nWhen it was all over it was a surreal feeling.  We were homeless and lost everything that didn't fit in one car. (The other car got left behind during one of the evacuations and flooded.)\n\nOh and I haven't even gotten to the \"This is real\" moment.  That moment didn't come until about a week after the flood while we were living in a tiny room at my sister-in-laws house; my wife, me, 3 year old daughter, dog, cat and fish.  After about a week, the shell shock wore off and I thought, \"This is our new life now.  This is real.  I'm so glad we have each other and no one was hurt.\"\n\nWe're still homeless.  Living at the moment at my mother-in-laws house.  But we hope to buy a new home soon.\n\n[Drone footage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3FqAJUs1s8)\n\n[Rescue during the flood.

In the eye of the storm it was eerily quiet compared to the howling winds that had blown down every neighborhood fence. I knew that my smoke break was over, and the eye was nearly passed, when I saw a 30ft tall tree coming down the road towards me,  roots dragging the ground...\n\nI lived with a cop at the time,  and had several friends who were EMS and firefighters.  Despite the media blackouts,  they told me, for two weeks afterwards they were pulling 50-100  bodies out of the water everyday around Galveston island. \n\nWhere I lived at the time, power was out for three weeks after. Gas stations were dry.  Grocery stores were rationing, and only letting in a dozen or so people at a time.  An illegal curfew was implemented. Cops would pull you over just for being on the road. \n\nMy cop roommate had left me with a shot gun to protect the house while he was on duty during the storm and the day after. \nThree guys broke into my neighbor's backyard and ours (the fences were blown down) and tried to steal the neighbor's generator, and smashed the back window to our house. I ended up firing at and hitting one of them. But they all got away.  Supposedly there were riots in some places.    \n\nI realize we were lucky where we were at.  Whole neighborhoods had been wiped clean from the face of the Earth,  you could hardly tell they were ever there at all.   \n\nI was born during hurricane Alecia, took my drivers test during Allison, evacuated for Rita, survived Ike, and now I don't live on the coast!

I started hearing about fire that had spread to Twin Creeks and Cherokee Orchard. These areas are directly next to the city proper. But I'm a town over, so I should be safe. Then I heard fire trucks approaching my house, and we were told by the fire department that we had to leave. Oh shit, this real.\n\nVideos started coming in of the mountains surrounding Gatlinburg. Everything was on fire. The city center was fine, but everything else was burning. It looked like magma flows on the mountains. Oh shit, this is REAL.\n\nAnd then the news started talking about people trapped in a hotel by fire. My dad was in that hotel. Everyone made it out of the hotel, but it didn't look good for a while.\n\nIt felt even more real the next day, when I heard that they had found three bodies. Then five. Then 10. They're still finding remains. I think last official count was 14.

All this is happening on a clear sky hot  day with a nice stiff wind that is welcome in the heat. \n\nDuring the storm: Unless you are in the shit, it is pretty manageable. The problem is outside of the people getting the direct hit, you don't know where the shit is going to be.  I'll use Isaac for example, I was in Baton Rouge and it was nothing. 40 miles south and it was hell.

Heart-felt stories, interviews with survivors, the artificial voices of celebrities calling for the listener to have a soul, and help.

Then people start moving towards the beach, so I go to have a look. There was a massive chunk taken out of the horizon. We just watched it. For like, 10 mins. The sea started to retract, and the fisherman boosted out to sea without saying anything. People uneasily moved away, but continued to watch. The moment I saw the speed the sea was coming back, I knew shit was about to get real. I and everyone around me ran. A girl got caught, and her partner managed to snatch her back out.

I notice it seemed like it was too dark outside for as early as it was and it's eerily calm too. I idly pulled out my phone to check the weather radar and confirm my suspicions. I'm alarmed to discover a classic hook echo near the leading edge of a severe supercell that's heading directly for our little town, (\"hook echoes\" are a strong indication of rotation within a thunderstorm). I'd seen quite a few severe storms over the years but I knew from what I could interpret from radar data that this one was likely different. I then hastily looked out our other apartment window to the Northwest and see the sky is almost jet, fucking, black. A few moments later the sirens go off we pack up our cats and haul ass to a family member's house because the apartment complex doesn't have a real basement. It hadn't even reached us yet but just being outside in close proximity to this behemoth of a storm was otherworldly. The storm rumbled continuously, LOUD, broken only by other more pronounced cracks of thunder from lightning striking closer by, but it NEVER stopped. This electrical storm began to put on one hell of a light show as it drew nearer and the street lights began to come on at 5:00 in the afternoon. When we eventually retreated to the basement all hell was breaking loose outside, I couldn't see much through the EGRESS windows but it sounded like a goddamn freight train was rolling through the neighborhood, for like an hour. We ended up being fairly lucky, overall damage was negligible, downed trees, broken windows and such.

I'd been told in school that this was a sign of a major tornado, so I did what I'd been told and made myself the lowest thing in the area. \n\nIn all honesty I probably would've taken less damage of I'd just run to my house. Maybe not. It turns out that an F4 tornado had touched down just a few miles down the road. But I lay there, getting pelted until the storm passed, like I'd been told to do. \n\nThe second was in 1989. I was only 15 when Hurricane Hugo passed over my head.The power was out, no lights, no news, pre-internet. I'm up on the trunk of a tree that is currently on the roof of my house, operating a chainsaw for the first time in my life, trying to cut it loose to prevent further damage as the eye of the bloody hurricane passed over. \n\nFuck you dad for making me do that. \n\nThis was the event that made me love having a natural gas stove. Even though power was out for days we were able to make hot coffee for the entire neighborhood, cook hot meals for the neighborhood, and have hot water for baths. \n\nThe last one was in 2000. I'm driving home to River Oaks, TX. I'm taking a right off of Belknap onto Jacksboro Hwy the sky turns yellow. If you don't know, this is a sign of SEVERE storm activity and/or a tornado. I floored it, getting home in just enough time to for the tornado to touch down. \n\nPart of the Bank of America sign landed in our \"yard\". We were pretty much unable to leave our house for 3 days due to downed trees, damage to electrical lines, and blocked roads. \n\nThis is just what I remember now.

Our house was on a hill, so we were fine, but we spent the days leading up to it helping as many friends as possible prepare their homes - a lot of sandbagging and moving furniture upstairs. Two families were out of town during that time so we had to deal with the whole thing and give them updates. One family was right on the river, maybe 50 meters from a ferry terminal, and we were working right up until the police forced us to evacuate the area. That evacuation (while watching the waters rise and trying to get stuff done in time was my 'oh shit' moment).\n\nThe thing that stuck with me most (other than the smell of the aftermath! hard to describe, but it was a bit like pepper?) was the community spirit afterwards. People would just turn up in affected neighbourhoods unannounced and would help the clean up. We had some friends whose house was flooded above the entire first floor - we actually took parts of their walls to our house, cleaned it, and sent it back - along with their sad looking pot plants.\n\nThere was a lot of volunteering, and a lot of construction/heavy vehicle business offered their vehicles and drivers for free.\n\nWeirdest thing was that there were a lot of pop-up sausage sizzles. I'm not sure if that's the term other countries use for it, but it's essentially a little stand selling sausages in bread, and soft drinks.\n\nA similar flood happened a year later, which wasn't so bad. No 'oh shit' moment there - we had seen worse.",

Not your normal small earthquake, the kind you know. This is something deeper, sharper and something you automatically know is serious. You wake up under your desk, having scrambled under the nearest solid object before fully conscious. Then everyone piles out, stands around, and waits for it to be ok.\n\nThat wasn't Feb 11. That was September 4, 2010.\n\nWhat followed was months of rebuilding, of political talk, of watching the closed buildings and clearing rubble. Of insurance claims and getting your life back together. Nobody died, but that's just our building code. Five months of being on edge.\n\nThen, just as the new year is starting properly and schools and universities are getting back on, just at lunchtime, a jolt. Not a slow sway, but hard, aggressive. A peak vertical acceleration of 2G. You're awake anyway, braced in your doorway as the entire flat throws around you. You hope, as bad as it felt that it's going to be ok. That it's just going to be damage and a few days of aftershock tension.\n\nThen you turn on the TV.\n\nEarthquake injuries and deaths had always been a foreign thing. That occurred in other countries with bad buildings. But the TV and radio were fast. Images, shock and horror from just a couple of kilometers away in the center of the city. Building fronts fallen down, people trapped and crying, bloody and screaming.\n\nThe shaking had stopped. But it wasn't over.\n\nThe city got shook to bits. People were dead. Buildings collapsed. 185 dead. Days without water supply, some places weeks. Power was out for days and weeks for people.\n\nNearly six years on? We're not rebuilt. Parts of the middle of town are simple gravel lots. The cathedral is a gaping urban ruin in red tape wrapping.\n\nDisasters are one thing, but how it can mess with your mind is another. We had a serious earthquake a month and a bit ago, that basically cut a major town off from the rest of the country. It was felt up and down the islands. This one went on for multiple minutes. It was soft and rolly in my city, which meant it was far away, but it kept on going.\n\nAll I could think of was those poor souls near the middle. I know we live on shakey isles, and we have building codes and preparation, civil defence and the earthquake commission. That people, in a disaster are good people, who help out, who are charitable, and who are kind.\n\nBut there lurks something at the back of your mind, something that you never really remember day to day. That it could go all so sideways so quickly. I'm a hundred km or so from the middle of the Alpine Fault, the source of the island I live on and it's mountain ranges. The fault is overdue to rupture, and has about 9 meters of pent up movement.\n\nSo, /u/technid, what was my \"Oh shit, this is real\" moment? 22 February 2011 at 12:51 p.m. 5 months after an earthquake, after the middle of town had been gutted and shit ruined, and then it all came again, and worse, and this time lethal.\n\nTo people who go through these kinds of events.\n\nKia Kaha.

We were told to be back at our hotels around 6pm when it was scheduled to hit and everyone seemed pretty chill about it. Anyway, we decided to not let this ruin our holiday, so we thought we would go out for a while and then head back to the hotel around 4pm. So it hits 4 and we're in an underground mall in the subway station that was about two stops away from our hotel. We planned to walk from the subway to the hotel as it was about a 20 minute walk.\n\nAnyway, my \"Oh shit, this is real\" moment was when we surfaced from the tube station and two of my friends (who were walking in front of me and my other friend) disappeared. When we got to the top of the steps we could see why. The typhoon had hit harder and earlier than expected. Our friends had essentially been blown out of the entrance of the tube station and were nowhere to be seen. We were quickly swept out but managed to grab hold of a nearby statue and get to the door of a nearby shopping centre, where security let us inside. We could see lamp posts swaying so much in the mind that we thought they were going to snap and stuff flying around everywhere. Cue a frantic bout of trying to contact my other friends. \n\nEventually we found them at another door of the shopping centre and managed to persuade the guard to let them in. We spent a while huddled together in the basement of the shopping centre with a bunch of other people until the fire brigade came and tied a rope between the entrance of the mall and the entrance of the subway and escorted us across it one-by-one.

I love on a street almost a mile away from the river, several meters above the water level.\n\nWe were warned about flooding in the area, potential flash floods, etc.  Fairly usual for a Queensland summer.  This time however there had been a lot of rain and flash flooding further north which eventually filtered down to the river.\n\nMy younger brother was getting nervous and thought we should evacuate.  We spent hours trying to dissuade him.  The water had never gotten to less than 1-2 meters away from our street level (we live across from a catchment so we can easily see the water levels during heavy rain).  After a few more hours, the water levels were getting much higher than we'd seen before and thought it best if we move our cars to higher ground \"just in case it got to street level\".  Later, we moved a lot of furniture and electronics upstairs.  \"Just in case it got a few inches in the bottom floor\".\n\nEventually we decided to leave.  The water was getting close to the street level which only meant another foot from reaching our bottom floor.  We left to spend the night with family who live in a neighbourhood close by.  We had heard that the water had risen further, but had no idea how far as it was dark and we couldn't see anything from our cousin's house.\n\nThe next morning there was no power.  We thought the flood must have effected the power elsewhere and blacked out a large area.  We left their house to go check on ours, only to see neighbours grabbing bags of clothes and other items and heading down the road.  That was my first \"oh shit...\" moment.  Our cousin's house was at the end of a long road, fairly elevated, but with a dip in the middle of the road leading to the rise.  This dip at it's lowest was about 1-2 meters underwater and some good Samaritans were helping evacuate people from what had essentially become a small suburban island via dingy. \n\nWe got across this new river and met up with some friends who lived near us (just up the hill from our house) who picked us up in their 4x4.  We had to take back-streets as several of the lower main roads were underwater, but we managed to get home.\n\nMy biggest \"Oh shit...\" moment was when we finally got to see our house.  There is a highschool behind our house, which is at the base of this large hill, with an elevated sports oval right behind our house.  The water at it's height was about 2 inches from being level with the oval.  We walked across it to survey our house.  Seeing water lapping at the bedroom windows on the second floor of our house was the most surreal experience I have ever had.  \n\nThis may not seem like a huge amount to some people.  Floods happen and water rises sometimes, however this particular flood was recorded at reaching 19.4 metres (64 ft) at it's peak.  Basically, if I look out my windows right now, I can't even see a body of water in any direction.  To have it come up *that high* overnight just blew my mind.\n\ntl;dr Watching flood waters reaching the second floor of my house, where previously I had never seen it reach even three meters below our bottom floor level.\n\nEdit: I put together some [before/after](http://imgur.com/a/ut1CG) photos, though an aerial view doesn't quite do it justice.",

Right?\n\nWell, we were travelling home to pick up some stuff, but the roads were packed. Everyone was trying to get somewhere. Then we started seeing water bombers fly over our heads. Then cars started jumping curbs and driving down sidewalks around us. We started hearing honking and yelling.

Right in front of us were cars turning around and instantly stuck in gridlock traffic as the fire raged closer. That was our \"Oh shit\" moment.\n\nLuckily, the police took over quickly and directed all traffic in one direction away from the fire.

                    "body": "The Butte wildfire in California 2015.  It started a couple days before the \"this is really happening moment\" and the entire time neighbors and myself were *sure* the fire would be under control in no time. Wrong.  It was Friday afternoon, two days after fire broke out, the entire sky was orangish-red with the summer sun trying to penetrate the thick smoke, ashes falling like snow.  My property (was) densely forested so the only way to gauge the fires distance was by the increasingly audible noises it was making.  It started as  a low rumbling accompanied with the occasional exploding water or propane tank.  That's when it started to get real, every boom was the fire taking a house, a neighbor's house.  The power had gone out earlier and since my water comes from a well, no power=no water, I'll never forget how helpless I felt when the sprinklers I had placed around my home fell silent.  I was packing what I thought was most important, literally cramming my car with things.  In hindsight, I really needed to A) prioritize better, I left passport, birth certificate and nostalgic things.  B) started packing on day one.  (LPT for y'all)\n\nBy then it was closer to evening and the rumble of the fire had grown to a roar that words fail to describe.  I think the freight train comparison so many use lacks the full spectrum.  It's a never ending relentless inhalation, leaving only louder, closer explosions and the ashes to escape.  (There, I tried) As I was bringing another load to my car I caught a glimpse of  a sherif's car at the end of my 1/4 mile driveway with a frantic arm waving out the window, motioning me to leave, then he left.\nRoughly a minute or two later, my good friend's fianc\u00e9 who live together about a mile towards where the fire was coming from sped up my driveway frantic and in tears saying that he was still at the house trying to find their cat and round up the chickens and that she could see the fire from their home.  She begged me to go convince him to leave, which I did.  That's the first I saw of the fire, when I got to their property.  I could only see the fire jumping and \"licking\" at the sky as the flames climbed the tree canopy, still, despite the intensity, it seemed to be about a mile away.  With out much debate, he agreed it was time. FYI he found the cat.  There wasn't anywhere to put the chickens tho, so we opened the coop to at the very least give them a chance to run.  We go back to my house, they're getting ready to leave and for whatever reason I had an overwhelming urge to stay myself.  I guess I still thought there might be something I could do.  They, of course, return the favor and convince me to follow them.  So we drove another mile or so away to a nearby fire station.  There I ran into my closest neighbor who had evacuated earlier and from there we could make out the tallest trees around our homes.  An hour or two goes by, It was starting to get darker out as the sun was setting and the smoke grew denser, but we could see the fire reach those trees and the flames were at least a hundred feet tall. I couldn't see my house itself, but the inferno was there.And that's when I felt like, game over.  We were forced to leave the station.  Shock was settling in, I wasn't as emotional then as I would be later and my friends and I retreated even further, a good four or five miles to another friend's house.  We weren't there long before the winds picked up and the fire was closing in there as well, so, we all went to yet another friend's home even farther away.  We probably got there around 11pm and by 3 am the fire was in sight again.  At this point, I said fuck it, left the county and fire zone all together.  I made it to another buddies house around 5 am, opened his liquor cabinet and had breakfast with Jack Daniels.  I slept all day.  When I awoke I had that wishful thought anyone has when they first wake up after a crazy night: \"shit, was that all just a dream?\"\n\nAnywho, there is an uplifting part, that evening I got a call from another neighbor, who was helping anyway he could with his tractor.  The badass never left!  He called to say my house made it, it actually fucking made it!  First thing in the morning I jumped in my car and sped back home, literally blew off a CHP officer/road block and got back in.  That's when it was truly real, and harder on me than anything preceding that point.  I was driving through the smoldering remains of the very same town that was full of homes and tall trees just the day before.  Fires were still burning and smoldering everywhere, I was driving over downed power lines and past blackened road signs.  I actually had a hard time reckoning where I was on a  rd I'd driven at least twice daily for the better half of a decade.  On the way in I saw that the last house we evacuated to had also made it.  My best friends home, the home we went to after the fire station, didn't make it.  I was the first to get back there to find out so I had to call my friend and break the news.  Cellphones were still working, but it was a short call anyway.  He basically said, \"whelp, thanks for letting me know.\"  I bawled for a couple minutes after that looking around the rubble.  I could make out the wire frame of the couch and the metal skeleton of his stationary bike that sat next to it.  Such total destruction but the fire left everything where it originally was.  I didn't spend much time there.  I went home, and sure enough, it was there.  There was literally a twenty so foot barrier ring that separated my house and the rest of the smoldering, otherworldly scene.  I came to learn that not long after I left, a fire crew came to my property and started a backfire (actually found backfire flares in my yard), keeping those flames in control long enough to give my neighbor and I a small buffer from the encroaching wildfire.  It worked, for us, but the four homes farther down the road were lost.  My sheds, outbuildings, garden, fencing and 90% of the trees were toast, but against all odds my house was there.\n\nI stayed there, and was alone for the first couple days.  No power, but I was able to siphon water from the tank to drink and put spot fires out.  I went and checked on as many properties as I could reach safely (there were hollow trees burning themselves out to the point of collapsing in any direction) and sharing the good or, more often, bad news.  A couple days later, the fire was farther away and folks found ways of getting themselves and supplies in.  It was two weeks before I got a generator and three weeks till the roads started opening back up.  Power and phone were out much longer before being restored.  The whole time, some friends and neighbors who lost their homes gradually came and stayed at mine.  At one point there were 12 people in a 2 bedroom 1000sq ft home.  But I'm glad there were so many of us, it leant itself to be good support.  \n\nThat was a year and a half ago, there's still thousands of scorched trees waiting to fall, burnt out cars on properties with an empty hole where a home once stood.  But people are now rebuilding their lives.  \n\nTo this day, but most intensely at the beginning, I carry a sense of survivor's guilt.  I felt relief, but I could never feel rejoice in my good fortune while so many close friends, neighbors and strangers suffered such complete devastation.  I didn't know why they were able to save my house and so few others.  But then I got to meet the firefighters, which really helped to change my perspective.  A week or so after things calmed down a group of them walked up my driveway.  I initially thought they were looking for lingering spot fires and after greeting them asked them so.  The one in charge smiled and said \"No, just wanted to meet the guy who's house we saved.\"\nIt took a lot not to break down then and there.  I shook all their hands and hugged them.  The captain even had a video on his phone of them courageously battling flames on my property, on behalf of me, a stranger.  I knew then that if they had it their way, of course they'd have saved every single house.  But that was never a possibility.  They did the very best they could and I'll forever be thankful and have the upmost respect of them for that.\n\nWe chatted a bit and I asked for a way to contact them.  They were a crew out of Santa Barbara.  They took my info down and said they'd be in touch.  Unfortunately, I haven't heard from anyone to date.  But if you know any firefighter that served during this particular fire from Santa Barbara, I'd love to get in touch.  I even promised to get them a pizza a week for a year or something along those lines.  I'd like to make good on that, least I could do.  Sounds like a possible job for Reddit!!\n\nAny way, that turned out longer than anticipated.  Thanks for reading.\n\nTl;dr: wild fires are crazy, have your most cherished and irreplaceable items on a mental or physical list and don't waste anytime packing and being ready to evacuate.  Also, firefighters are unimaginably great people, hug a firefighter today!!! And if you or someone you know sounds like one of the fire fighters from Santa Barbara, I'd love to get in touch!Thanks!\n\nEdit: typos",

Most of you probably already know, but the standard procedure for this is to have all the students line the hallway and stay in a less than comfortable position. Anyway, we were out in the hallway for at least an hour and most of us were just sort of lounging around at this point. We talked with each other and complained about inane nonsense. \n\nAfter some more time, the principal says that if you can contact your parents (cell phones weren't completely ubiquitous at this point), and they were willing to pick you up, you could go home. Naturally, I phoned my step-mother but she said I would be safer at the school. Some more time passes and all of us are getting pretty irritated. Kids start getting up and walking around and everyone is restless. \n\nThen the power goes out. A student screams. The power comes back on. The other students laugh nervously. Lights go out again and a girl cries, \"What is happening?\" The principal responds, \"Real bad weather.\"  \n\n\"No shit.\"\n\nAnd that's when you hear it. This loud bastard of nature. The glass blows out in the window next to me and the door swings open and all you hear is this booming sound and kids screaming. I sat next to some guy and cuddled the fuck out of him. I felt a lot of debris hit me but I didn't really feel anything. It was strange. After about 30 seconds it ended. I looked up and a piece of pipe was literally an inch away from lobotomizing me. \n\nThen I saw was a scene out of a movie. There was devastation everywhere. Blood, concrete, and kids crying their eyes out. I sat there in a daze for a few minutes in disbelief that something like this could have happened. Some random kid and I went to the auto shop to find some car jacks to help lift the debris off of students trapped in the rubble.

(Long story, sorry for hijacking your post but it all resonates with me very deeply.)\n\nI have horses, and me and my friends had actually gone to watch a horse show in New Mexico when the fires started; we were driving through the night back to San Diego and I was asleep in the backseat of the car when I suddenly heard one of my friend talking on the phone in the front seat and asking, \"There's a fire at the barn?\"\n\nNow, all of us were in a car two states away, and all of our horses were back in San Diego. We all called our friends and family at 4am, pleading them to go rescue our horses. My mom and Dad lived about 30 miles from where the fires were occurring, and my dad said the ash was so thick even that far away that it covered his car like snow. He told me when they pulled up to the barn and saw the fires not a hundred yards away on either side of the barn, that was the moment he wasn't sure whether they were going to make it out alive or be trapped (there was only one road leading into and out of the barn).\n\nIn the end, our families walked 12 horses three miles to safety to the local rodeo grounds. I eventually made it and held my horse for 14 hours while the Red Cross distributed water and feed before we were told we could go back to our barn. Unfortunately, another friend of mine was not so lucky; she kept her horses at home (she lived at the top of a mountain), and with the fire spreading so quickly, she was unable to hitch her trailer in time. In desperation, she turned her horses loose on the hills, hoping they would find their way down the mountain, but they panicked and returned to their stalls where they died of smoke inhalation.\n\nLater I drove around the area with my trailer looking for anyone who needed help evacuating, and I'll never forget the warped white plastic fences that had melted in the heat of the fires, nor the way the fires burning on the hillside glowed at night (the fire raged for like 4 days before it was contained). Also, the ash falling from the sky and the haze that turned the sun red. Living in San Diego, I'd never experienced a snow day in my life; that week, school was cancelled every day. That fire was without a doubt one of the most surreal experiences of my life.",

Someone had a radio that had the fire communications and I terrifyingly remember the panicked voices telling them to \"get out and try and save some houses\". That was the Oh Shit moment for me.\n\nThat and the emergency warning siren.",

I went up the movies haha\". Like, what? Of course there was a fire warning, people fucking died and the edge of Bargo caught fire, Jesus Christ. \n\nI'm glad I'm back in the UK.

There wasn't anything to film because what used to be a 4 bedroom 3 bath house was a spot of dirt surrounded by more dirt and around that, which used to be a neighborhood, was more dirt, and the occasional cow carcass and piece of twisted metal.\n\nNear his aunts house he found signs from like 15 miles away (I can't remember how far actually, but it was ridiculous).

I remember my friends and I weren't too concerned about it as the storm approached. The \"shit just hit the fan\" moment was when James Spann (the local meteorologist who quite possibly could be the best in his field of work in the whole country; cannot say enough good things about his tireless work) requested a switch to the live cam which had Bryant-Denny stadium in the foreground. It was terrifying, because you could step outside my patio door and see the stadium. Easily less than a half mile walk from my house at the time to the stadium. \n\nSo as my friends and I quickly followed James' advice and sought refuge in the closet closest to the center of the house, I decided to quickly step out my front door and see if I could see anything. What I saw is something I'll never forget. At least 4-5 vortices spinning off the main tornado and black debris swirling in the air around it.

Normally we'd go bushwalking in the National Park, but they closed the whole thing due to the fires the day we got there, so we were just stuck in town in Jindabyne. Nothing to do, so we hired a boat to go out on the lake. It seemed the safest place to be.  \n  Fucking eeriest experience I have ever had. It was about three in the afternoon, and dark as the middle of the night from the smoke. Except for the intense glowing patches where the fires were: one to the west and one to the north.  \n  The one in the west was the one in the National Park, the one that the bush still hasn't recovered from fourteen years later. The one in the north was Canberra. We watched that one get redder and more intense, knowing that something terrible must have been happening up there. All the while, burnt leaves were just raining down on us.  \n  It's impossible to describe what it looked like, but this was right as the *Lord of the Rings* films were coming out, and it was honestly like being in Mordor - endless night, billowing smoke and just the glow of fire.  \n  A few days later we headed to the coast for the second part of the trip, and the beaches were just littered with ash and burnt leaves that had been blown out to sea and washed back up.  \n  I lived in the Blue Mountains through the 1994, 2001 and 2013 fires, and I've never seen a fire like that one.",

I was young, grew up poor, and my family decided to board up the windows and hunker down instead of the mandatory evacuation. Garage door came flying inwards towards the house because a tree flew into it, huge tree in the back yard fell onto the back porch and a small portion of the house. We basically huddled in the kitchen, the direct center of the house with no windows, and trembled in fear for hours. My poor cat stayed with me the whole time trembling. My fish also died Im assuming from pressure change and stress? My brothers and I went outside during the eye and found a lost dog, who we returned to the owner after everything cleared up. Spent the next 10 days without power or water. Faught in line for generators at home depot/lowes/etc.  Only ones they had left were super small and only powered a fridge and one fan. Miserably hot and humid. Grocery stores were empty. It was really hard for me to understand at that time, I was about 6 or 7 years old. I remember being super happy that we got to dig a hole for a fire pit in the back yard, but didnt understand that we did that so we could cook food. Thankfully my mother was a super couponer and had hundreds of canned items, and my father was an avid hunter, so we had tons of frozen meat. 5 kids total and it took us the majority of 6 days to clean up the one tree in the back yard, and tried our best to clean up the house and move all the scrap and rubble to the street. After we did our house, my brothers and I would walk the neighborhood and offer help cleaning up, and I definitely remember the FEMA \"X\" markings, and I remember crying (alot) because one of my elderly neighbors died in her home alone because the hurricane caused her roof to cave in on her.  We also volunteered at the shelters, and opened our home (what was left) to a couple families who stayed with us for a few weeks after. I honestly cant say I remember any looters in my neighborhood, but now that Im older my siblings have told me they kept me away from seeing it. Hurricane charlie was low rated to begin with and wasnt anywhere projected to hit near us, so \"stubborn floridians\" didnt prepare like they should have. As soon as it hit the warm gulf and hooked back towards us it turned Cat. 5 and fucked us. Hurricanes suck, you never know how well you should prepare because they can change in a matter of hours. My house now is always stocked for emergency. And we keep a go-bag in case of evacuation. ",

The roof has really stuck with me over the years because it flew by kind of tilted sideways and I could see the individual tiles flapping in the wind as it went past in seemingly slow motion. \n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had arrived, it was gone and we could hear \"werewolves of london\" song coming from the record player.\n\nWe went outside and the houses on either side of ours were completely destroyed as well as the giant willow tree in our front yard which had twisted so far that it had cracked all along it's trunk and half the branches were tore off.

He wasnt shitting. We lived in houston, and even when we saw the eye of the storm, it was still some serious shit. Power went out, gas prices spiked like hell, and some convience stores were boarded with guys sitting on the roof with rifles. When we came home we had to park in the very front of the trailer park because the flood was about 4 ft high. Ike left a shithole.",

Guy starts off talking about how he'd just moved into this new place, where the landlady had the downstairs portion, and he was in one upstairs room, and a random Chinese guy in the other upstairs room. Chinese guy was very shy and didn't talk much. The whole duration of sandy, the Chinese guy was holed up in his room, while this guy was in his. He realized that guy hadn't come out at all and left some snacks outside his door and knocked. This went on for two days. The third day, the landlady was pissed the Chinese guy hadn't paid rent and knocked. No answer. Half a day passes, no answer.\n\nThey broke the door down and found the Chinese guy dead in his bed. \n\nGuy had been leaving out food for a dead man. Creeped him out and he was having nightmares, so we let him stay with us until he found another place.\n\n_____    \n\n\nI had just moved to my new place by the water in Queens when sandy hit. Four of us, two of whom I had only met that morning huddled up in a little studio apartment, no internet, no gas (hadn't been hooked up yet).\n\nThe oh shit moment was when i went to canal street to buy stuff for the new place, and they announced they were shutting down the MTA. \n\nSecond oh shit moment was when my friend in alphabet city sent me that clip of the entire front wall of that apartment building falling off. \n\nThird was when friends actually trekked from the east side to my apartment because they didn't have electricity or water.

The day before they saw sense. Cue 16 people packed into a 900 sq ft house, trying to pack what we could into a trailer, as quickly as we could. One of their neighbors laughed and told us he was staying. He was going to video what he could and post it on the community message board. We begged him to evacuate, but he said \"I weathered the last big one, I'll weather this too.\" \n\nIt was surreal for us. My house is 40 miles from my parents. Where we were, there was absolutely nothing going on. Gusts of maybe 40 MPH winds. \"This isn't so bad, I bet the house is fine, let's check out the message board. \" True to his word, our neighbor was posting videos. This was before live streams, so they were just 5 minute videos loaded onto the message board. Rising water. Flooded streets. A few hours before Sandy even really hit, he took a video that included our house. It was 2 feet under water. Finally the neighbor said \"No, this could kill me\" and radio'd the last call evacuation boats to pick him up. His last video that day was him motoring off, waving goodbye to our neighborhood. My mother was in tears, and I've literally only seen this woman cry one other time in my life. Turns out she had scaled back the flood insurance the month prior.\n\nThe flooding wound up about four feet up in the kitchen. No one was allowed back on the island for almost a week because live wires were down in the flooded streets and for some reason they couldn't figure out how to isolate and cut the electricity to them. There are still homes in the neighborhood that haven't been rebuilt. So many empty lots. So many for sale signs. ",

I was in NY celebrating my bridal shower and my husband was home. He called me stating they were doing evacuations. Work was obviously cancelled and he wanted to be with us so he followed the evacuation route. He said until he hit jersey all the toll booths were just go no paying no nothing just go and the average speed was over 80. If you weren't being an asshole the cops didn't care they just wanted you gone. As it turned out NY got hit way, way worse than us. We tried to leave NY and it too us 4 extra hours because so many roads and highways were closed. \nThen the next year another pretty bad hurricane hit, I believe it was Sandy. We bunkered down. I learned then that the south is way more prepared. NY was devastated. We lost power in Virginia for less than 24 hours. Our electric company actually sent trucks up to NY. ",

Thinking about how quickly and easily you can get there, one might fall on you or the thing you are hiding under, and if it can handle that thing falling on it.",

After food ran out the waiting in line for gas so you could drive to an MRE and ice station and wait in line there became routine. The boats INSIDE OF HOUSES, the piano in someone's yard from someone's house across the water. So surreal. \n\nWe would hear rumors of convenient stores opening up to sell whatever they had before it spoiled. Seeing a local grocery price gouge $5 per tomato they had left and then the cops force them to make amends somehow so they got a giant semi of ice brought in to give away free. \n\nFilling up kiddie pools to stay cool in the 90 something degree heat. Not wanting to keep generators on Bc we were in a bad area and wouldn't be able to hear someone breaking in. \n\nand found out Pizza Hut got power 2 weeks after the storm and got a truck of pizza stuff delivered. There was only pepperoni and they had a flat price you paid in cash and you got canned drinks but let me tell you that was the best pizza fucking ever. \n\nI missed a whole month of school during my senior year which at first was fun then totally sucked. I distinctly remembered a friend when we returned telling her story of her family friend dying in the storm. The next girl told her story of losing their beach vacation condo and all the new appliances they bought for it. I still want to punch her. \n\n",

When the floor was ripped out, you could see the ground below in places. Every wall had  to be taken down from floor to ceiling (Latham plaster). Then they got the first bill from the mitigation company. They billed for twice as many men as actually worked. They billed for their meals and hotel rooms (um, wait you knocked on our door... we didn't call you here). This was one of the big companies too. My parents' insurance company estimated it was about $20k over what it should have been and now additional charges they told my dad not to pay. Apparently fraud is big business after disasters. As is price gauging. The moment I realized how so many scumbags were taking advantage of people who had just lost so much... that was even more heartbreaking. Disasters definitely bring out the best in people volunteering their time and donating money, but they bring out the opportunists too unfortunately. ",

I think it was just a stupid story or poem she had made us do. Well after this argument my mum had to come into class (as with every other time I \"acted out\"), all she did was look at the work, correct my spelling of tsunami and tell the teacher I was right. She had never heard of it before and decided that I was making stuff up since it was a Japanese word. We did whole topics on them after the boxing day tsunami though. ",

Everest of straw at this point and died a long time ago, but for others that camel is standing on top of the mountain of straw, planting an American flag, and his name is Joe Camel and he rides a motorcycle and he grabs pussy whenever he wants and fuck you he'll never die, America.\n\nHere's the thing:  I don't think you're going to get many actual responses.  I don't think the people who voted for Donald Trump did so for any rational reasons, they did so for emotional ones. They were persuaded by his extremely powerful rhetoric, the near-hypnosis level techniques he uses, fell into party line, etc.  Honestly, even the people who can list a variety of reasons like \"he will make america great\", \"he is an outsider\", \"he represents a dramatic change from the status quo\", or even just \"I hate Hillary\" aren't listing rational choices, they're describing ex post facto explanations for why they \"chose\" who they did.  Human beings don't make choices rationally--the entire field of behavioral economics is based on that premise, as is pretty much all of cognitive psychology, magic, NLP, hypnosis, sales, advertising, and persuasion.   \n\nIf you take the conservative side of certain key pivotal issues that the media have decided are make-it-or-break-it issues, issues that are controversial because they are matters of conscience (abortion, gun control, paying taxes, the use of military force), you likely have not changed your mind.  These issues (yes, including taxation for most of America) basically don't affect most people's daily lives, but they can be used to leverage in whatever you want.  The democrats kill babies, want to take your guns and raise your taxes, so everything else they have to say is irrelevant.  It's a strongarm tactic that both sides use and it's nonsense.  Neither side is consistent in their thinking.  Are you pro life or pro choice?  Regarding abortion you know your stance, but what about regarding guns?  Because most Americans espouse two seemingly  dissonant philosophical ideals at the same time, and justify their beliefs as they see fit.  It's not rational because it's advertisement. People hate the ACA, but the states that don't have supplemental aid to make it affordable are often the ones whose republican governors refused the supplemental funding specifically so that the ACA would fail.  They sacrificed the health of their constituents for political reasons.  The same people who believe in a free market economy and will sacrifice the health of their fellow people to win a political victory down the road by defeating the ACA, well they call this a country founded on Christian values.   \n\nThese issues don't affect you on a day to day basis, either.  They're not nearly as pertinent to you as education, healthcare, civil rights and liberties, freedom of speech, corporate welfare and corporate legislation, the sanctity of the 4th pillar of the government, environmental preservation, poverty, opiate addiction, the corruption of the criminal justice system and militarization of the police, wasteful spending by the government, global warming or the quality of your work environment.  But those issues sit very much on the back shelf--if they were front and center issues, I can't imagine how any modern Republican could hold power.    Quite a few Democrats have to get the fuck out as well. \n\nMy point is, it's not the average voter's fault--they're being fucked with, deliberately, by people smarter, more organized, and more resourceful than they realize.  And it may actually NOT be a conspiracy per se, just that we've reached the limits of a morally sound republic.  As genius and well-read as our founding fathers were, they could not have foreseen a country as vast as ours dealing with as many complex issues. Political science, as advanced as it has come, hasn't generated an amazing like-minded group of educated revolutionaries to propose anything better designed to cope with a modern world and the weaknesses of the human psyche than the shitshow we're working with.  At least not one capable of dealing with a country of this size.  So in the meantime this country is a clusterfuck.  \n\nI saw Sara Silverman last night, and she asked the audience at the theater who believed in God.  3 people clapped.   In the middle of the country even in big cities it would be everyone.  I don't see how we can reasonably coexist as one country when you have populations that are divided by fundamental precepts of the reality they walk through on a daily basis, let alone how we're supposed to choose one person to represent our ideals.  I for one think Rome is burning.\n\nEdit--thanks for the gold!  I just ran out :)\n",

I've been pretty angry the last few weeks, and although I don't really consider myself a Democrat anymore, I sure as shit am not a Republican either. I've harbored a lot of anger towards the Republican Party these last eight years if not longer. When you publicly state during Obamas first week in office that your main goal is to make sure he doesn't get re elected, the country's best interest is not what you have in mind. It's about the parties best interests, it's about smearing the other group to make you look better. It's a bunch of children in complete and utter control of all of our lives throwing temper tantrums. This \"us\" vs \"them\" attitude has grown so far beyond old and now EVERYONE is angry beyond words. Say what you want about Obamas policies (success or failure, but do not deny he has had a lot of success), the Republican Party made it their mission to block every single bill he proposed and look what has happened. The funny thing is, Republicans proposed many bills that were very similar to Democrats but because it had Obamas name on it and he'd get some of the credit, they deny it! Look how much hate there is. Look how divided we all are! This is how you control a population, divide and conquer. It's not \"only\" a lack of education, it's a lack of accountability. We live in an age of zero accountability, it's always someone else's fault, and no one takes responsibility or gets prosecuted if they're high ranking enough, especially if they are...\nTo all the people on this thread, you da real mvps!",

However I am beginning to grow extremely disappointed in the party as a whole and I'd like to see Trump challenge the status quo more than he has. I post on T_D and argue with liberals on here a bunch, but honestly I agree with most of their thinking. \n\nThe republican party is failing me as a young republican. The old guard that makes up the money in the party and throws their weight around is unwilling to come to terms with the reality we are living in. And every so often I get into arguments with fellow republicans who say I am too liberal. \n\nThe republican party has always been labeled the country-club party for rich old white men. Well, that's mostly true. I've been to fundraisers for senators and the people there were in fact, well off white people. They detested Trump to the core and raved about the other candidates. So what we have here is an image problem. \n\nSecondly, the issues that the republicans stand for. I'm a business conservative. That was the original republican. Small government and all that jazz. However we have drifted away from being the party of small government. We're now using the government to tell people how to live. We're always seen as being at a war with Women, gays, minorities, everyone sees us as the party that is using the big arm of government to make people do things. That's not what the party was about. The party is supposed to be small federal government and more in line with states rights. If a state wants to legalize abortion, well I may not agree with it, but fuck me they voted to do that. \n\nI'm regretting being labeled as something I am not. I'm not anti-gay. I'm not racist. I'm not something that many people label me as because of my political leanings. \n\nI believe in climate change because I believe science is real, it's not some fairytale. I believe that if Adam and Steve want to get married and have lots of gay sex in their bedroom at night, they should be able to do that, it doesn't affect me. If an American citizen wants to exercise their right to vote I do not believe we should make that harder than it should be. \n\nI am not regretting voting for Trump. I am regretting that Trump may not be able to branch out because he may have to walk party lines. That is where I start having a problem because I want to republican party to move to the left on the issues I stated before. \n\n\n",

He is also taking the first weekend off after all his talk about what he will do in his \"First hours in office!!\". His inauguration is already a pity party which shows him as the unpopular loser he actually is. Some of his voters are suddenly worried now he will allow the GOP to strip them of their health insurance too or unfund public schools so yeah there is a bit to be going on with already.\n\nYep, that's basically the long and the short of it!  I would add emphasis to his poking China with a stick over Taiwan.  He treats it like a game, like it's one of his deal making schemes, but China is *not* fucking around.  He fails to realize this at all our peril.

So  we never thought about the chasm income inequality would create. Because this is not about not liking certain religions or nationalities, but about the disenfranchised (e.g., those rust belt workers living in poverty) feeling they would be better off without certain groups. I don't think Americans in general are against muslims or Mexicans but they have been completely manipulated and drank the kool aid form Trump's campaign and they are fighting imaginary enemies instead of realizing they are poor because the 1% is capturing public wealth as their own due to the current tax system, which is exactly what a billionaire wants.

It costs $250 in Canada for *three months*.\n\nI recommend that anybody with high price meds check out canadadrugsonline.com. Some of the newest drugs may not be available yet, but you can easily search their site and find out. Shipping is always $10. I've been using them for years.\n\nEdited to say: Make sure you get the generic if there is one. The name brands aren't nearly as cheap. There are generics available through Canada that aren't available in the US (big surprise). Another thing is that it'll take around three weeks to receive your meds, so you have to plan ahead. Even though they are brokered in Canada, they can come from a lot of different countries. One of mine routinely comes from New Zealand, and another from India.\n\nEdited again to provide the proper URL for canadadrugsonline.com.",

We don't want to become like Egypt or some junta, where military leaders run the government. It's bad for democracy.

Like, after this election we collectively took a look in the mirror and said, \"fuck it, every man for himself, dog eat dog world, you and me against the world buddy\".  I even started investing.  I'm going to turn into a heartless suit someday, aren't I?  This is how people become Republicans.  You beat the liberal out of them with crushing and bitter disappointment.  I'm not even joking, I was taking a look at a chart of \"welfare\" states v.s taxpayer states, AkA which states take more than they give and which give more than they take, noticed all my favorites were the taxpayer ones and all the ones I hated (Arkansas, Kansas, etc.) were the welfare queens, and said \"hey maybe states right isn't such a bad idea\".  We can lower federal taxes so rednecks who don't want any of this globalist coastal elite liberal money can go like, die in their trailer parks or whatever, and we can have the blue states just look of for number one and only spend our tax money on ourselves.  Oh, is Jebediah dying from an oppoid addiction?  I'd like to help with all this damn Obamacare money, but woops, they voted for Trump, so nothing I can do, oh well.  Oh hey, does Juan Carlos in california need a kidney transplant so he can keep picking avacados and send his Dreamer kids to college?  Well what do you know, we happen to have some extra taxpayer money around, let's spend some of this surplus on the Americans who actually like us.  Hey, if \"Real America\" wants their Ayn Rand, anarcho capitalist, religious theocratic crypto fascist hellhole, they can have it. Us pinko liberal crybabies in the actual revenue generating states can like, wipe our tears with all of our money or something.\n\nI know it's selfish, but I'm just so tired of caring about them.  If they don't want our help, fine.  Let Jesus save them or whatever.  Blue states will just, take care of our own from now on I guess.\n",

It's okay to spend time finishing school, getting settled, finding a way to pay the bills. Stay involved in some small way and know that even if you're feeling discouraged now, in a few years it won't feel that way. And more boomers will have retired by then, so who knows? It may be a great time to get reinvigorated then! Until then, don't worry. Finish school, pay your bills. Those of us who are a little bit older will lead the charge, and you can catch up in a bit.

Jeb was by far the GOP's best choice, Rubio in a close second, but what do I know, I was 100% sure that Trump would lose in a landslide, both in the popular vote and in the electoral college.",

She was in support pretty much 100 percent across the board of liberal policies.\n\nBut on election day she voted trump. \n\nThe reasoning was that there was no reasoning. Her family was die hard Republicans and they would vote Republican if the candidate was Hillary. Let that sink in.

You supported someone that was actively working against all the things you cared about. You were fucking a typical stupid American.

We need someone to light the match that perhaps will provide us with a means to change direction. Perhaps trump is the beginning of the end.

It's things like that, more than the gross \"haha, pm me b00bs\" fellows that make me want to keep my gender private while I'm gaming (which, then, just allows the stereotype of gamers as all being male to perpetuate).",

I find out from my Program Director that he wanted to see my resume.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst day of class, I start to introduce the class (not myself). A student immediately interrupted and asked me why a sub was teaching the first day.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy former Program Director switched jobs with me when the other school we worked at closed down. He ended up at the same level - an instructor (sweet revenge). I walked into his classroom one day to greet him, and he said, in front of students, \"I can't believe they let a girl teach hardware here. Ha ha ha.\"\n\nI just smiled and left.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first couple of semesters, after the class is over, the students have the ability to evaluate the instructors via a survey. I have had multiple comments along the lines of \"can't believe she is a girl and knew as much as she did.\" They ended up complimenting me, but always the same \"omg lulz like a gurl can teach IT\" came through.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's gotten better, but it's still an uphill struggle.

She didn't want to tell anyone because she figured it would destroy the family.  Jump forward six months, and we break up over unrelated matters.  The brother(my best friend) called me to a park to talk about it.  I was pretty nervous that our friendship would end and the conversation when I got there was leaning towards that.  Petty, but we were 15.  \n\nIn a kind of last ditch effort, I told him about her uncle and what she told me.  The conversation was then completely off me and the break up and onto her uncle.  We sat there for a long time and I held him as he cried.  The fallout from it was massive; the uncle was outed, his wife divorced him, he lost his job, etc. There was major rifts and divides across the entire family that lasted for a very long time.  Their family has basically never been the same because of it. \n\nI know what I did was right, because people like her uncle can't be trusted and the truth should always come out.  But in complete honesty, at the time I told my best friend about the uncle I wasn't thinking about any of that.  I was simply trying to distract my friend and take the guilt off me.  I've never told anyone that and it kind of feels good to let it out.  I wasn't any social justice warrior or even a hero for outing a bad guy, I was just a kid who was nervous.",

And then 3) when I finally got to see a doctor, they had to call a second doctor before I could undergo surgery due to my insurance needing a second opinion. With all of those delays they were only able to save one testicle, while the other one had to be removed.\n\nWith that being said, if you have a son who is at the late elementary/early middle school age and they suddenly feel an intense pain in their private area for no apparent reason, please get them to the Emergency Room ASAP.",

I didn't even connect the dots until I was 14, and I didn't feel that bad about it then.\n\nHonestly, the event probably impacts me more than i give it credit for and I think if i really wanted to just correlate things i would relate a decline in self-valuation to this event.

When I was 15, I had very few friends, and the friends I did have were from Tumblr, pre SJW days, when it was a bunch of emo kids cutting themselves and crying over Pierce the veil lyrics. One person, a girl (not) named Alex, was the first person I ever spoke to on there. She was like the first person I was able to open up to about the problems I was dealing with (I was a bizzare kid, who wore Vintage Hockey Jerseys to school everyday, and had a pretty weird bum leg) bullying, previous trauma, suicidal thoughts. We were close, Tumblr and Alex were like an escape for me. Things were less hostile there, and it made coping easier, ( Both me and Alex were self harmers, so it was a good way to find help before resorting to that) and gave me something to look forward to, even a little bit, every day. So things went on, school was still shit, but it was that little less shitty until just over half a year later. She had gone to a doctor about some fainting she had been having. I thought it was because at the time, her self harm had sort of progressed into Bullimia, and that she was so frail and weak that she was fainting. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It was some heart disease, that meant she'd have only a few months to live before the heart failed on her. They tried to find a donor to replace the heart, but the wait list was longer than the time she had and her Family didn't have the money to pay to find an alternative donation method (Trailer park, working minimum wage only affords so much). She kept going in to check up while trying to become more and more distant to me (she figured she didn't want to hurt me by suddenly dying, kinda shitty logic, but we were young) Make a Wish actually Granted her a Wish and she got to See All Time Low in their House Party Tour and meet the band, she said it was the most fun she'd ever had. But that was the high point, as she began deteriorating fast, she had frequent heart palpitations and chest pains. These progressed until one night, Alex was hospitalized. She sent me a message letting me know what happened and that she was certain that she wouldn't be coming home. She said goodbye and said that I would make it through the hardship I was currently in. Her dad later told me what had happened and that she was gone. He asked if there was anyone else he should tell about it and moved on. High School was rough after that, but I made it through relatively unscathed. I still miss her to this day, she was a fantastic friend.",

                    "body": "**TL;DR : I buried my best friend.**\n\nMy best friend, let\u2019s call him Doctor Manhattan, hung himself two years ago. He was an ex-African refugee from the war in Rwanda, with a very promising career in physics. He actually had an offer to work at the LHC, and he looked very much forward to it \u2013 that is, until he committed suicide, of course.\n\nIt took all of us by surprise.  He has always been a very dark individual, and not only by the color of his skin : he definitely had the most fucked up sense of humor I\u2019ve ever seen. We\u2019re talking about disguising himself as a plantation slave for Halloween, or pretending to be named \u00abKunta Kinte\u00bb when a stranger asked his name. \n\nAnyway.\n\nSince he died in the middle of Winter, and that I live in a country where it is impossible to bury the dead in the frozen ground, we had to wait until Summer to actually bury him.\n\nThat very day, unfortunately, I had to work extra for some bullshit reason. Immediately after my shift, I ran to the cemetary as fast as I could. It was not really far from there, but still ; I did not want to miss that.\n\nHalfway there, I suddenly heard bells ringing, and singing. I knew too well what that meant.\n\nI missed it. It was too late.\n\nAs I came upon the cemetary upon the hill, nobody was left there.\n\nWell, almost nobody. \n\nManhattan only had two white friends in the city ; me, and Green Lantern. And Green Lantern was next to the coffin, crying.\n\nI went up to him, and asked him what was wrong.\n\n**GreenLantern :** \u00abManhattan's dead, you fucking retard\u00bb.\n\n**BassyBoss :** \u00abYeah, but he\u2019s been that way for months. What\u2019s wrong?\u00bb\n\nHe looked at me, with tears in his eyes. After a long moment of silence, he finally uttered the right words.\n\n**GreenLantern :** \u00abI can\u2019t get over it, *man*.\u00bb\n\n**BassyBoss :** \u00abWell, so can\u2019t I, and I missed the fucking ceremony.\u00bb\n\n**GreenLantern :** \u00abFuck, *man*.\u00bb\n\nThe heaviest silence fell upon the cemetary, with our dead superhero buddy next to us. Almost as if he wasn't the most silent one out there. When I had an idea.\n\n**BassyBoss :** \u00abLet\u2019s fucking bury him.\u00bb*\n\nGreen Lantern stopped crying.\n\n\u00abWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u00bb he said in amidst of a chuckle.\n\n**BassyBoss :** \u00abLet\u2019s bury Manhattan. He would have loved it. Come on man.\u00bb\n\n**GreenLantern :** \u00abOh, that\u2019s so fucked up.\u00bb\n\n**BassyBoss :**  \u00abYeah, but he was.\u00bb\n\n**GreenLantern :** \u00abYou\u2019re right.\u00bb\n\nSo that\u2019s how me and my buddy ended up shoveling dirt with our barehands upon the coffin of our dead friend, grieving in about 15 minutes. \n",

A lot of my day I sit in bed just depressed about what I'm gonna do with my life and how I am gonna explain to my parents that I am just awful. I have a very close knit group of friends who I talk to regularly, I don't really like making new friends. Every time we hang out I struggle trying not to let my depression get noticed and just end up bringing everyone down. Sometimes I occasionally bring up like suicide as a joke, I hate it when i do this... I don't even know why I do this, I try to avoid this but it ends up just coming out.

I wasn't 18 so I couldn't buy a dildo (when I turned 18 I used my bday money to buy one...another slightly sad thought). I was jonesing for something in my butt. I had tried a sharpie, a few fingers, there were sadly no cucumbers or anything similar nearby either. Then, a thought comes to me as I scan my room. My eyes meet my Great-grandfathers hand carved axe. The handle is shaped rather penis like, the end is like a dick-head, and almost a foot long! It has a carving on it of my Great grandfathers initials. I'm thinking...owch. It's remarkably smooth, I wouldn't get a splinter even if I tried, but the intials look rough on the ass. I shuffle for the free condoms I got handed to me at a recent festival I went to. This should make it a little smoother, right? I lube it up with Vaseline after covering it with a condom, and take it to pound town on myself. It was pretty nice, 10/10. Now I have it sitting in my room, 4 years later. It's mine now since my grandfather passed and everytime I see it I think of the night my 100 year old family heirloom pounded my ass as I busted the greatest nut my pure gay teen heart had known thus far.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/wlTOXP0",

I go to a pretty prestigious university in my country and I'm doing fine, I have a pretty good social life, I'm involved in quite a few sports and committees in my residence (one of which I may head next year), and above all I'm happy. But I'm 2 years younger than most local guys as I didn't have to serve National Service(which is mandatory for all guys here. Usually you have to have some major condition in order for you to not have to serve NS in my country). When people ask me why I didn't have to be conscripted, I always link it back to me having some other random medical disorder. The truth is that I have high functioning autism (not Aspergers) and I was bullied pretty hard in Secondary School (or Grades 7-8ish?), therefore the medical officers decided that I shouldn't be conscripted as they were worried about how I would react if I had to be conscripted. A lot of people told me that this was actually good, but it wasn't that good for me as I knew that I couldn't take any jobs in the public service, and I had to change my major as my country wouldn't allow me to take that certain major if I didn't serve National Service (as there was a military-related bond afterwards). \n\nI know that there have been significant advances made in debunking the stereotypes that people with autism has, but I have to keep this secret from others as any mental \"disorders\" or \"developmental issues\" are basically taboo in my society-no one would look at me the same if I told them the genuine reason why I wasn't conscripted, and whatever progress I have made to stop being socially awkward and to \"overcome\" my autistic tendencies per se would go down the drain. Basically only my family and relatives know that I have autism, and it's an unspoken rule for everyone that no one mentions anything to others about the fact that I have autism and have went to special schools before.",

I have no studied experience nor methodology to prove and I blatantly robbed him, justifying it to myself with a Robin Hood-esque philosophy. I've changed some minor details for the sale of confidentiality but this is the jist of the story: \n\nI was staying at a student-oreintated hostel (bob Marley posters, charmingly beligerant Austrians, blatant spliff garden etc).  I met the man in question at the outdoor improvised bar one night; he was flirting terribly and sweatily with a group of French girls who weren't reciprocating in any measurable way.  He wasn't a bad looking nor  particularly repulsive-acting guy, but it was clear that he had a genuine talent for steering conversations into the ditch and adding unnecessary tension to all interactions.  Before he'd even introduced himself I could tell that he had some kind of misconstrued basis for what he was doing (I suspect he'd been watching lots of these 'one liners which will escalate conversations instantly' 'how to get her number in under a minute' brand of videos online). Long story short, I got talking to the girls and we decided to go to a nightclub later.  Richboy tags along vaguely despite seeming oddly distant towards the end of the encounter with the girls and I end up sleeping with one of them that night. \n\nNext day I'm chilling in the spliff garden by myself  and richboy approaches me in a kind of 'enter scene: richboy' manner.  By this I mean that I have no idea how he knew I would be there but he definitely did and it seemed oddly premeditated.  He says something to the effect of: 'mate, how did you do that last night?' I'm all 'do what?' even though I have my suspicions by this point.  He goes on to explain that he infact IS NOT staying at the hostel, but rather came here to talk to women, and that he's running on funds from a high earning job in order to finance an 'enlightening' stay in Eastern Europe during which he plans to learn how to be an expert seducer. Bit creepy, but I don't judge.  From last night's display, it might not have been such a worthless idea. It was bad. He attempted the classic yawn monouver on one of the girls  whilst we were comparing regional politics (with expected results).  \n  \nAnyway, being the cocky shit that I am, and seeing as we have no company, I start giving him casual advice.  Add to this that I'm at a stage in my life whereby I'd recently been through a long-term breakup and was shagging excessively to nurse my poor little heart whilst masquerading as a casonova, and you have the perfect mix for disaster.  It starts with simple tips like 'you need to put the other person in a situation whereby they feel relaxed and open in your company' and citing specific examples of where he'd fucked up the other night.  We talked for about 20 mins before I left to explore the city.  I arrive back to a message from guess who?  This one was more than a simple 'whoa, you get hot chicks': it was a straight up job offer. \n\nI don't really have an excuse for what happened next. I won't lie that womanizing is a thin veil for my underlying anxieties and that I'd had an ego boost from giving the richboy advice that morning.  Regardless of the reasons, I agreed to his terms and we scheduled the day. \n\nI made a plan.  I tried to consolidate any tangible ideas or philosophies that I had on the subject and complied it all into a session.  I hit him with the biggest wall of bullshit I've ever constructed.  It was sadistically genius and most likely sociopathic.  I swindled him with pseudo-science philosophy akin to that  peddled by cult leaders.  It wasn't sinister and itwas purposely vague but it certainly wasn't a code I live by.  If there's any consolation it's that I think I safely eradicated most of the YouTube pick-up trash that was clogging up his mind.  I tried to tie it into a deeper 'improve yourself and you'll attract women' sentiment, but I was in no position to preach this.  \n\nIn the end I couldn't bring myself to accept richboys payment.

They didn't live far from where I grew up so I went out on a Friday night with my friends from home. I took an uber back to my Aunt's house and drunkenly called a hooker around 3 am. I had her (and her driver) roll up to my aunt and uncle's white picket fence neighborhood, pick me up, drive me to the ATM to get cash, and come back. We went inside, the driver stayed in the car. We went upstairs and I fucked her for about 5 minutes until she started demanding I nut soon.

I try to lower his expectations for the rest of the evening, but in the process of doing so, revealed that I was broke and incredibly hungry.\n\nSo he bought me a crazy expensive steak and a bunch of appetizers that would keep well (for comparison, my normal diet during this period was about 80% ramen). Due to the uncomfortable mixture of appreciation and guilt this induced in me, I ended up having (and pretending to enjoy) what was easily the worst sex of my life. He was not good at it and at the same time *really* into it. I want you to picture being banged by the Tasmanian Devil on meth. Male jiggle physics were very much in play. It was a pretty dark half hour.\n\nDude was a total gentleman otherwise, though, so after a fairly awkward ride back to my place, I stuffed the fridge with my leftovers, told my roommates my parents took me out to dinner, and spent the next week better nourished than I had been for the previous month- while trying to ignore the nagging feeling that I might have technically dabbled in prostitution and was generally kind of a shallow person.\n\ntl;dr- had some really bad sex (which I could easily have said no to) in exchange for some really good food.",

It was a complete write off for us, basically a total loss of time and money. \n\nAnyway my boss tasked me with finding the kid and turning him in.

I really don't want to get him in trouble. My boss reluctantly agreed. But the secret, what none of them know, what they will never know - is that I am actually the kid's father. That's right. This guy who has been causing all of our headaches, all of our financial trouble at the company with his rival group, is actually my son. \n \nThere isn't even a shred of doubt, biologically, he is in fact my son.

I had a best friend who was 15 and honestly a lot of people were surprised at how old she was because how mature she was for her age, I took her into the city a couple with me because she wanted to experience the party life. Now back then I was still figuring out how to hold my liquor, I did a lot better than this girl because she used to down vodka like it was water for the point of \"getting drunk as possible\" which is what she would say. One night we were in the harvard stadium at late hours and my boyfriend was with us, we were all very intoxicated and me and him snuck up to the bathroom for a quickie and left her alone. We came back down like 7 minutes later and everything was fine, about 20 minutes later she started puking (kinda her own fault, we kept telling her to slow down) well my bf ran half a mile to the store and picked up food and water for her and she was fine the next morning of course. She was upset I left her alone, saying that she didn't feel like she even mattered to me. I felt incredibly guilty and promised I would never do it again.\n\nA month or so goes by and she begs me to take her back out into the city, I am a little reluctant to do so because I know that I don't make the best decisions with alcohol but she begged so I was like yeah alright. We go into boston and get alcohol, she proceeds to get drunk as possible and I wanted to stay moderately sober but she kept pushing drinks into my face and so I got pretty messed up. We were with my boyfriend and some guys that I knew of but were still pretty sketchy, just drinking in one of the parks everyone goes to smoke at. The cops rolled in and everyone ran in different directions. My best friend, bf, and me all ended up safely away from the cops and two of the guys from the party came with (over 23) and one was a total dead beat and the other a pretty good guy. we ended up by the river side at a bench, my boyfriend convinced me to sneak away so we left my friend with the two guys... and I have never regretted anything so much. No, she did not get raped but one of the guys with her was trying to get her to drink more with the obvious intention to do so. I have done a lot of messed up shit, but I think this is something that has really stuck with me.  ",

There's a few out there who really still believe me. It's too stupid, yet funny so, I don't even say anything ",

The instant it hit, I ducked down below the strawberry bin.  The guy it hit turned around and saw the guy who'd been walking between us and instantly blamed him for plunking him with the strawberry.  He charged over, hurling death threats and abuse, it took a couple other people to pull the guy away and settle him down.  And he was a big dude, he'd have killed that guy.

I've told people about nearly fucking my male dog (I'm also male) when I was around 12 or 13. Consciously building emotional barriers to keep distanced from all the death in my family I've been subjugated to. Not feeling the 'unconditional love' towards my family, including parents and sister. However my thoughts are a completely different story. \n\nI have homicidal thoughts a lot. It's not the kind of thing I can bring up and really expect help with. The fear of being locked up in a psych ward is very real to me. I'm a drug addict and so I've spent my fair share of time in wards and jails. With my depression I can take meds, and talk about it with psychs and even those around me, but not these other thoughts. I know about intrusive thoughts, like wanting to careen my car into the highway divider for shits n giggles. Being able to recognize that those kinds of thoughts are relatively common helped. Knowing I'm not the only one that thought about and even tried to kill myself helped. But these killing thoughts are not something I've ever heard anyone talk about. \n\nI created a fictional character to associate with these thoughts and feelings. Named him Fury. He's a destructive, emotionless soldier. Someone that gives my thoughts an excuse to run with and play with in my head. In the past this character was a terrific indicator of how I was doing mentally. The more I thought about him, or found myself thinking about him, the worse off I was. Really he's still a perfect indicator. Perhaps he's been showing up more because my levels of stress have been rising lately.\n\nIt's just weird. In a room of a few hundred drug addicts, many of whom have beaten, broken, and even killed others, I feel alone all over again. ",

Anyway, I passed the bowl to her and she said \"no, that's yours.\" Since she filled it for me, and it's not real pot anyways, I finished the whole bowl myself. When we headed in to start the work day I immediately started to feel ill. I turned completely white and thought I was going to shit my pants. I ran to the nearest bathroom, pushed down my pants and flopped down on the toilet. Instead of having the shit of the century I was expecting, I ended up vomiting all down my front and down into my pants that were around my ankles. So, now I'm covered in vomit with the added bonus of it looking like I shit my pants as well. After sitting there for a minute contemplating the situation (possible drug test, losing my job, etc) I decided to go \"full shame\". I didn't even try to clean myself. All I did was present myself to my manager covered in vomit and say \"i'm sick\" and I was out the door with no questions asked.",

You never really know what other people are going through, and sometimes I can't help but wonder if somebody's just quiet or suffering from severe depression. \n\nIn elementary school it seems like it was so easy to make friends; you all bond over similar interests. A TV show? Books? Video Games? Yeah, you can talk about that endlessly. Even if it's just making dumb jokes like \"I know you are, but what am I?\" or just running around crazy-- you could make friends with the kid you meet in the park, and not even question a thing about their personality, clique, gender, race, or interests. \n\nThe older you get it seems like the more people have become comfortable in their childhood group of friends, and meeting new people becomes less of a socially acceptable/common thing. By adulthood, you will find that unless you actively try to make new friends, you will be utterly alone. Loneliness becomes a huge issue when maturity takes hold, because judgments, interests, and personality start to take a huge role in who you CAN even be friends with. \n\nSo if you're in a healthy and happy life right now with the right connections, a good amount of friends and family, do all you can to not take them for granted. Because it's really devastatingly difficult to be utterly alone and even harder to recover (especially when you estranged yourself from a large group of friends). I learned this the hard way, and this is why I now try to treat everyone with respect, decency, and integrity. Even having a polite exchange with the bus driver can really make your day. Likability comes a long way in the battle against loneliness and depression. ",

He lived on the second floor and his only neighbor across the hall was 420 friendly so we never ran into any issues being a little crazy. One night, my friend who rented the apartment was so drunk he put on his motorcycle helmet, ran down to the parking lot and ran head first into a car parked right in front of his apartment. It was hilarious when the alarm started going off until the owner came out and immediately started calling the police. As soon as he heard him say \"I'm calling the cops!\" my friend took off sprinting into the night still with his helmet on. So here me and my other friend (both under age and also drunk) are standing in his apartment and he's gone. My friend turns to me and says \"We should run!\" but it was too late, the car owner had saw us watching from the balcony and he was now pissed at us because my helmeted friend was gone. It was too late to run away but we decided we could hide out at the apartment across the hall. We ran to the neighbor to hide out and after about 10 minutes we realized we had just decided to hide in an apartment filled with drugs. It was a rollercoaster of a night. ",

I start law school in the fall and got a fatty scholarship at my top pick school, too. You can turn it around.\n\nVisit your school's health services and ask to speak with a therapist, have your depression documented (you can share suicidal ideation or not- I know it runs the risk of you being reported for your own safety but you should really get help).\n\nIf it's documented you can likely get a retroactive withdrawal granted for your classes and take time to get yourself together before trying again. I took less than a year off before realizing college is what I wanted, then went to a community college for two years because I had no idea how anything worked and didn't know I could have grade forgiveness granted. Finished up two years at my CC and moved back to my undergrad (I could have gone back without any time at a CC but I didn't know it at the time; being at a junior college helped me adjust better, though).\n\nSpent a year at my school before a major family issue resulted in me failing a bio class (I was a bio major) and having my financial aid taken away. I was depressed again but also determined because I had worked so hard to get back in school, knew I didn't want to do biology anyway, I just thought I had to because if family pressure. Changed majors to communication, ended up with two degrees in the field, awards for my involvement on campus  and academically and landed internships with congressmen and a full time job while I studied for the LSAT (alone, no classes or anything) and then crushed the LSAT and am going to be able to pursue the only career that has made me legitimately optimistic for my future.\n\nIt's easy to feel the emptiness in your chest from depression, or the weight of your stress that makes your limbs feel like anchors, and it can feel impossible to overcome that burning rage that makes you want to scream and break things because everything has somehow gone so wrong. I promise you, though, suicide does not fix it because all your are doing is succumbing. It feels like it can't be done, but you can totally survive this and thrive in life still. Grades are grades, and they are repairable.\n\nKeep momentum and move toward making happiness in your life, and every time it feels difficult remember that it has been done by others and it can be done by you.

We had a strangely normal conversation lol, like you would with a barista.  \n \nAnyway she wrapped my tool, started jerking me off and I said something like, \"Oh man I wanna be inside you let's get this ball rolling!\"  \n \nAnd she was like, \"Sorry honey, I'm not full service.\"  \n \nSo I was like, \"What's that mean?\"  \n \nShe explained that it means I'm basically just gonna get a handjob.  \n \nShe was tugging for like 15 minutes and getting a little annoyed like, \"Are you close to finishing?\"  \n \nI had to be like, \"No offense, but I'm not a virgin or anything like that. I'm at a point in my life where it's hard to get off to a handjob through a condom\" She was like, \"Well you're gonna have to\" and went back at it. I finally busted like 20 minutes later, my dick was completely red and swollen from the whole thing lol  \n \nAs I was getting dressed I was like, \"Hey I'm not mad or anything. I totally understand it's part of the hustle, but I'm not thrilled at forking out 120 bucks for a handjob. Could you school me on how to get more *bang* for my buck if I get an escort in the future?\"  \n \nShe happily explained to me all the lingo, what to ask for upfront what not to say on the phone etc etc.  \n \nI thanked her and as I left she was like, \"What's your deal dude? You're not like a typical client, you look good in your little baseball cap and your stylish jeans. You aren't a virgin, I don't often get young guys like you.\" I told her I was just out of a bad breakup and had some xmas money from my grandma to burn.  \n \nShe ended up just complimenting me and encouraging me to just get out and try to date instead of spending grandma's money on pussy.\n \nThe confidence boost was better than the blowjob. Total sweetie, I saw her on campus once but out of politeness/discretion didn't acknowledge her.  \n \nWas a very surreal experience.",

She turns completely pale and just mutters \"it's not my blood\". Then I felt it. A poignant pain on my dick. Pull out and see that I'm profusely bleeding. Run to the shower to not bleed all over my bed. Passed out. I woke up to her sobbing naked kneeling beside my passed out body in the shower. Turns out she ripped my foreskin on a very delicate spot. To this day I have a minuscule piece of skin just happily flopping around my dick, that reminds me to always use lots of lube. \n\nAnd with time it became easier to have sex with her.

I thought he was a douche and only talked to him for the lolz because he's dumber than a rock. After I graduated their family ended up buying the house next door and we talked some. This was when he told me about wanting me in high school and I tried avoiding him after that because eww. \n\nEventually he brings our little bro to talk to me probably just to get me to talk since he hates silence. Little bro was my type. Yeah he was getting his GED and I was a college student they considered to be really smaet, but we had a lot in common. I asked him out, we've been together over 4 years now.\n\nSeeing that older brother started being a bigger asswipe than usual, I'm 90% sure he brought my boy friend out to play wingman and it failed miserably. Older bro had been single for a while and got more and more irrational until he got his girlfriend a few years later, another random chick from high school that I thought was a lesbian (brother is very feminine so I guess it is like having a girlfriend with a real strap on). \n\nHe calmed down after that so I'm thinking this is the truth but I really don't want to know. I've graduated college and my boyfriend is almost finished with his college program, all while older brother is almost 28 and still hasn't had a real job. I don't know where we'll end up as we become real adults but we'll certainly be better off than him.\n\nTldr: Older brother possibly tried using little bro as wingman and I've been with little bro 4 years and counting.

Your description fits a very typical case of [Dyspareunia](http://patient.info/health/dyspareunia-pain-having-sex) (an umbrella term for conditions which lead to pain during sex/masturbation). As another comment pointed out, it could be [Endometriosis](http://patient.info/health/endometriosis-leaflet) but this would also show spotted bleeding between periods and/or painful periods. I suspect your description may be a specific condition called [Vulvodynia](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vulvodynia/Pages/Introduction.aspx). It's associated with sharp pain during sex or when inserting a finger/dildo/tampon/object. Severity can range from only sharp pain on occasion to pain every time, even when trying to insert 1 finger. Speaking to a gynaecologist will help determine if this is the case, and a therapy routine aimed at making you used to insertion can be started. Of course what you describe could be something else entirely, such as an infection, so in any case please see a doctor. The least I could recommend is researching on the two topics linked above.\n\nSource: 3rd year medical student who studied for and just passed the obstetrics and gynaecology term paper.

Alfred says, thats cool Ill be Charlize from now on( changed his name). this has gone on for over 50 years, never legally changed it or anything, just gave his identity to his bro and created a new one.",

Some how I managed to fall back asleep and slept for 3 hours and was awoken by the worse pain iv ever felt. Drove my self 20 miles to the nearest hospital and checked in. It took almost 2 hours to get back to be checked out because I didn't seem like I was in that much pain. At this point my lefty is gone. Been dead for a while due to the lack of blood flow. Luckily they saved righty, and attached him on the inside so he is no longer able to twist. The pain of the surgery was nothing to that of the torsion. 1 year later my wife and I got pregnant  (was worried thinking it was not mine) and now have a 2 year old healthy brat.",

Often its the muscles that are the closest to the opening that hurt the most.

But finger's are short and almost only hit the outer walls which only results in a really painful burning sensation really.
