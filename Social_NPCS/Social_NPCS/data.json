A cute girl overheard me and said, \"Hey, I know how to cut hair!\" She gave me a haircut in the hallway and then asked if I wanted to go to Steak & Shake. I said sure. \n\nIt's been 13 years, we're married, and she still gives me haircuts. About two years into the relationship, she confessed that she had no idea how to cut hair but really wanted an excuse to hang out with me. She did it in the hallway and asked me to Steak & Shake because she didn't want me to look in a mirror and see the results. \n\nShe's actually pretty good at it now, though!",

I didn't want her to get pissed off at me for bingo dobbing her forehead so I concluded, in my drunken stupor, that I had no other choice than to bingo dob myself...So I did. Years went by and it was always a mystery who bingo daubed everyone. The girl I liked at that party had been my girlfriend for several years now and I finally decided to come clean. She thought it was hilarious. But let me tell you, that ink they use in those bingo daubers is really hard to clean off your forehead. ",

I had a VCR at my parent's house and I would have dinner with them once a week, and then watch the latest episode of The Next Generation. It all came out one week when my GF and I were both over for dinner. We were getting ready to leave, when my mom says \"Aren't you going to watch Trek first?\" It was all out in the open. \n\nMy GF immediately felt bad for me, saying she would never have judged me for watching Trek. She even watched a few episodes with me I had on VHS at my parent's home. She liked it, and thought the stories and themes were good. \n\nTrying to assuage my fears further, a few months later she surprised me with tickets for both of us to a Star Trek Convention that was coming to town. So we went. After about 30 minutes walking around the Con, seeing autograph booths, vendors, and cosplayers, she leaned into me and whispered lovingly in my ear,\n\n\"You were right not to tell me.\"",

I think it healed his heart a little to talk about it, and I know that it made me love him even more somehow.  I'm just grateful that he was willing to open his heart up to love again.  He is an awesome man and the best thing that has ever happened to me.  Edit:  Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.  This one is for Dare Bear, for Debbie, and for me.  ",

Well, one day early in our relationship we got ice cream cones (also at a place we had both frequented as kids) and then took a walk to the school, which was down the street. As I reflected on old memories, like the mural we painted in first grade and the map of the United States painted on the blacktop, he had an a-ha moment and realized he did not in fact go to that school. He lived in another part of town so went to a different school, but continued to go along with it. On our one-year anniversary he admitted he actually went to the other school. He never said anything because he thought I'd be mad... in reality I couldn't have cared less but it made for a funny story.",

And then was scared to file every year after that. He had kept all his W2s and paperwork, so I got back tax forms, completed them and filed it all. \n\nThat initial year that started his big scare? He had made a simple math error, and had actually been owed a refund. The other years of + or -, plus the small fines, balanced out to a small amount refunded to him in the end. He was so relieved. \n\nHowever, it was a major warning sign for all of his huge anxiety, esteem, and avoidance issues that would make life with him so challenging. Sigh.",

Eventually it got out of control on my side, I didn't know how to deal with any of this anymore and was just froze in that mindset, that I couldn't fix things, that we just didn't work. I ended it 3 months ago and it's still fucking painful, I really really liked her, but I wasn't ready for the relationship I guess.\n\nOn one hand I think what she did was great, it's great to prepare your partner for this, but I also feel like it was a way of justifying some of her behaviors and to prevent her from trying to fix some underlying issues...\n\nI wish I could've done better :(",

As it happens I was using a marked deck (from an earlier trick) so I knew what each person was drawing as we went along.\n\nFirst person picked the Jack of Diamonds. Second person picked the Jack of Spades. Third person picked the Jack of Clubs. Fourth person picked the Jack of Hearts. Completely by coincidence.\n\nSo I flipped over the deck and spread it to show that it was a fair deck, with different cards throughout, as I reiterated what we'd done: \"Four people pulled cards of their own free will from a shuffled deck...\" etc. \"... and yet there's a connection between these people: something that puts them in sync - something magical.\" Then I had each flip over the card they'd chosen, one by one. Mind-blowing. I skipped the trick I'd been planning on, in the end: taking credit for a 1-in-20,000 chance was, in the end, more impressive.\n\n**tl;dr: sometimes, being a magician means taking credit for coincidences**",

I was 100% against it, myself.\n\nI was able to do quite a bit of growing on my own, what I needed a therapist for was to see a different perspective from someone who was a professional. Someone whose opinion I couldn't talk myself out of. \n\nThere's a lot of conditioning with serial abuse. What you might bring up to him: he could still be thinking in a way that is dangerous to him in the long run. Little things put there by the abuser to control a victim can really lead to self hatred and talking down to yourself. Having a professional tell you you're a good person is hard to ignore.\n\nThank you for the kind words. I honestly would love to talk to you. I have been trying to find people, like a support group, with no luck (as I don't want one based on religion). I'd like to talk with someone else who has a different experience with this/someone involved with this. I am also trying to work out all of the conditioning, so it helps to just talk.",

I know what it is. My great uncle falls into the category of drop off the meds as soon as you feel ok. Hell, I have the urge to reduce or stop them when I have long periods of good. What I meant, is why does bi-polar disorder, amongst all of the disorders, is KNOWN for dropping off meds. Off the top of my head, the only other disorder that is well know is maybe schizophrenia? Many people did point out that when we feel good, it's really good and we can easily convince ourselves that we can handle it. Maybe that's all it is, the disorder itself tends to create the image that we don't need the meds. \n\n\n\nTo those who's meds affect them badly, don't give up. Try new meds/ doctors and find one that doesn't do as bad. A lot of docs just stick with the ones everyone uses, or the ones that have been pimped out to them. Don't settle, there are meds that make your life livable again. I went through 4 this most recent time I changed. You deserve to have medicine that doesn't destroy your quality of life. If you think your meds are causing you more problems, and your doctor won't listen, keep searching. There will be a doctor who gets it. ",

First off, the majority of that earth is a ball of iron. the outside \"crust\" is really the only thing that might be considered edible. So we're going to \"skin\" the grape and eat the skin.\n\nThat skin is mostly saltwater and dirt.there is vegetation in there, too, plus creatures--but proportionally, they're relatively undetectable. SO basically, we have a small sip of salty mud mixed with a little vegetation and some micro-organisms. Congrats, you just ate a teaspoon of blech.\n\n**Result: a sip of muddy, grassy water and a metal ball bearing.**\n\n#Scenario 2\n\nWe assume \"shrinking\" the earth to be representing it with non-earth things. in this scenario, we represent the molten core with cheese, the oceans with pizza sauce, and the ground with flaky pastry.\n\n**Result: A Totino's Pizza Roll**",

It depends on what you do and don't scale, and what method of actually compressing you use.  Depending on method, it is also close to entering the realm of fiction.\n\nWithout going into the thermodynamics behind it, I'll say that temperature wouldn't shrink. It would probably either stay constant (if we shrink everything), or rise, because you need to add energy to the Earth to crush it, and you have a much smaller volume, so energy density increases.\n\nIn general, the only way of lowering the temperature is to change the internal energy of the object, either by transferring heat out of it or transforming the energy to forms which don't contribute to temperature (only motion of particles contribute to temperature).",

This works out to be roughly 1 gram of salt for every 476 grams of fries, which is 0.2% of the total mass. So a french fry contains ten times more salt by percent, than the Earth contains water.\n\nOf course, the amount of salt in saltwater is obviously a small fraction, so the ratio for Earth will be even less. [This /r/askscience question tells us that there are 4.9 x 10^19 kg of salt in the oceans.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1cyizs/if_all_the_salt_in_the_oceans_was_removed_and/) There is 1.4 x 10^21 kg of water in the oceans, so roughly 3.5% of the Earth's oceans are salt by mass. This means that the salt content of the Earth is even smaller - it's 7 x 10^-6 % of Earth's mass. That's a tiny fraction, and you're almost certainly not going to taste it.",

I'm studying engineering and working in the industry for half a year has shown me how little men, especially older, think of me.

I also feel like my interest in video games makes me more attractive to guys now, which is weird because before that's what made me the weird kid.\n\n\nPros are that I'm *much* more confident now. I feel okay saying no to people when before I would hesitate and agree to anything. I've also noticed that I actually care *less* what people think of me now. I'm totally comfortable going out dressed down, with no makeup and messy hair, which was hard for me before.\n\n\nCons are of course people tend to judge that I'm bitchy or unapproachable before talking to me.

At that point, I transform into either a *really* attractive guy or an utter buffoon, and determining which will win out is kind of a crap-shoot.\n\nThat, to my mind, is the thing that many \"average-looking\" folks seem to forget about being physically attractive. Sure, there's the *appearance* of having more opportunities when you're easy on the eyes, but by the same virtue, there are also more ways for things to end in an utter train-wreck.\n\nFor example, there was a time when I was hanging out at a club I used to frequent, and a young (attractive) woman walked up to me with a remark on how good I looked. I politely thanked her, returned the compliment, and then asked if she'd like to get a drink with me.\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" the girl replied, \"but I don't drink.\"\n\nI shrugged and offered what I hoped was a charming smile. \"Well, if you'd like, I could buy you something non-alcoholic.\"\n\n\"How about,\" she said, \"you just get your own drink and then meet me at a table so we can talk?\"\n\n\"Nah, I don't need a drink!\" I replied. \"That's just what people do, right? Buy each other drinks?\"\n\nThe young woman eyed me with the beginnings of suspicion. \"So, what? You don't want to talk to me?\"\n\n\"No, no, that's not what I...\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" snarled the girl, interrupting me. \"Were you expecting *me* to buy the drinks?\"\n\nMy response probably sounded rather like a frog with a stutter, and by the time I managed to regain control of my tongue, the young woman had walked away.\n\nNow, that may *sound* like it wasn't entirely my fault, or like the girl in question was someone best avoided anyway... but believe me when I say that I was the one to blame. My tone of voice, my meter, and even the broadness of my grin all probably made me look more like a handsome idiot than a decent date. I've played over that moment - and dozens like it - again and again in my head, and each time I invent new things that I *should have* said or done. Worse still is the fact that I never seem to learn from my mistakes, and my sense of humor is just as likely to make someone raise an eyebrow as it is to make them laugh.\n\nWhen everything is said and done, it's really personality that counts. Being attractive gets you in the door, of course, but you'll get kicked right back out again unless you manage to keep from messing things up.\n\n**TL;DR: Attractiveness affords opportunities, but they're still easy to blow.**",

It's not that I didn't like girls or anything but in high school I just wasn't concerned with having a girlfriend or having sex with anybody.  All I wanted to do was play PC games, get high or drunk and play in a punk band and girls would get in the way.  It got a little creepy sometimes too because one group of girls who were all friends got my number (back in the days of land lines) and would call my house all hours after school and late into the night saying things they wanted to do with me and do to them and it was fucking weird.  Then after a while because I wasn't going out with anyone rumors spread that I must be gay which in turn got me into a few unwarranted confrontations with a \"tough guy\" or two.  Like I said all this unwanted attention was more irritating than anything at the time because I just wanted to do what I wanted which was PLAY MY GOD DAMN PC GAMES AND GET HIGH OR DRUNK!  I ended up dropping out of high school about two months into my junior year and enrolled myself in one of those self paced charter schools where I ended up not having to get to know or talk to anyone until I got my diploma.  \n\nI'm married now and my wife says I'm hot which is nice and all but the best is that she doesn't bother me when I'm playing my PC games.",

                    "body": "When I was a kid strangers used to ask to take pictures with me or approach my mother and ask if they could pay for my lollies/ice cream/theme park ride/toy/book.  I was always the teacher's pet and would get perfect grades. I was the most popular girl in my grade and everyone would agree with everything that I said and want to be my friend. I knew this wasn't what \"normal\" kids experienced but I figured it was okay as long as I wasn't an arsehole. \n\nBut people would also say weird shit to me, too. At a primary school dance a concerned mother approached me and told me I looked like Jon Brent Ramsey and should be careful, because Jon Benet was a good example of what happens to girls who are too pretty. I was molested on numerous occasions as a child by both people I knew and strangers. \n\nI wasn't cute when I hit puberty. I had acne, frizzy hair and was overweight. I suddenly had a very clear picture of what life was like for people who weren't utterly adorable. Honestly, it wasn't as bad as I imagined it was. People spent more time actually talking to me, instead of agreeing with everything I said. I had to learn how to work hard for the things that I got instead of being handed things on a platter. I saw my friends enduring the horrible way boys would treat them and I didn't want for a second of it. \n\nThen I lost all my puppy fat, my skin cleared up and I learned how to do my hair and makeup. Suddenly, people were interested in me again. \n\nPros:\nPeople immediately like me and want to be my friend. I make a great first impression. I have never interviewed for a job that I haven't been offered. I'm the life of the party where ever I go. \n\nWhen I worked in hospitality while I was at uni, I made enough in tips to never have to touch my wages. I could pay rent and living expenses in cash. \n\nI don't get catcalled, except a few times in Italy. Sometimes people will stop me to tell me they hope I have a lovely day or that I have a beautiful smile, but they're always respectful. I have seen some of my friends get catcalled, and I consider this a huge pro, because I couldn't cope with that shit. \n\nPeople go out of their way for me constantly. We're talking bus drivers stopping in the middle of the street to let me cross illegally with a wave and a tip of the hat. I once had a bartender run five blocks to buy a bottle of my favourite gin for me out of his own pocket because they'd run out. I also once had a chef in a 5-star restaurant personally deliver me my entree when I'd ordered off menu because he just \"had to see the pretty girl\", and then they didn't even charge me for it. I constantly get upgraded. \n\nI can't even estimate how much booze and food I have gotten for free. \n\nI had a 100% hit rate on Tinder and over 10,000 matches in less than a year before I deleted the app. \n\nCons:\nPeople make eye contact constantly and I am always catching people staring at me. I am a very shy person, so this makes me uncomfortable. Men have come up to me in the street and admitted to \"watching me from afar\" for weeks. It's not nice to feel like you're constantly being watched. \n\nDating is hard, because people tend to be on their \"best behaviour\" to try and \"catch\" me, and then I discover I'm dating some complete stranger I don't know. The kind of men I'm attracted to are very rarely the first approach me, so I always have to be the one to throw myself out there. Almost everyone I have dated long-term has become insecure from the \"she's out of your league\" comments. I've never been turned down for sex or dates, though, which is nice. \n\nPeople don't take me as seriously in my job. I am always trotted out at client meetings, but it is almost always as eye candy. I'm practically laughed out of the door any time I try to run a meeting, until I explain that it's my meeting. Coworkers, clients and suppliers are constantly unprofessional towards me. I have lost clients because they have asked me out on dates and then been embarrassed when I've declined. \n\nSometimes I feel like people are only friends with me for the perks, like free drinks and upgrades and stuff. \n\nWhen I'm talking to, say, 50% of dudes, I can literally feel men imagining what it's like to have sex with me. \n\nI know one day it'll fade and people will go back to treating me the way they did when I was an average-looking teen. I constantly have to remind myself not to get big-headed and to appreciate everything that I have now before it's gone. ",

Like a farmer once gave me a flat of strawberries for free because of him.\n* He gets more chances than most kids. People will just keep letting him try again. Admittedly he is athletic too, so I'm not sure if it's his looks or his athleticism, but he had burned many bridges with crap behavior with friends. Nevertheless, they come back and still want to be buddies.\n* He is expected to be confident and a leader, so he fakes the part when he needs to. Honestly, he probably is a natural leader, but he's 14 years old -- he's not really confident. He just knows that people expect him to be, so he tries.\n* Weird people stop us to comment about his looks.

I was like wait... was I the catch in this equation?\n\n- I was forgiven for a variety of indiscretions I myself considered hard to forgive, and the forgiveness in several cases came in the form of additional indiscretions.\n\n- most of my close friends were of the opposite gender and they always HATED my new SO's.  I never understood it and wondered if I had bad taste in friends or partners.  Finally I was venting to another friend who pointed out, as though it was obvious, that my other friends wanted me for themselves.  My reaction was essentially \"oh.....OHHHHH............*ohhhhhhhh*...........\"  See also: indiscretions.\n\nPros: everyone makes mistakes in their 20's, and apparently it's easier to be forgiven when you have something people want.  it's fun to catch people looking sometimes.  people smile on the street and are kinder.  I don't have to flee from cameras anymore and when I get my hair styled or put extra time into my outfit etc, people really notice.\n\nCons: getting away with shitty behavior does not bring peace of mind.  you still have to forgive yourself, which is harder.  Also after marriage, I've found it harder to maintain friendships with members of the opposite gender, and people make a lot more assumptions about what I'm looking for.

Just yesterday I was in a very crowded elevator and an older man who reeked of booze started whispering gross shit in my ear. No one did anything to stop him. Things like this occur very often and it's absolutely disgusting and can also be very scary if you are alone. \nPeople will not take you seriously and will assume you are stupid.

I guess I expected there to be more objective signs of girls being attracted to me when in reality people act pretty much the same when you reach a certain level which at the beginning was a bit disappointing to my past ugly self. \n- A big con is that sometimes at work or at school it's hard to have some females take things seriously when I'm around. They become so overly giggly that even I notice it. Then it's just embarrassing to me because I feel like everyone is realizing what's going on. \n- Another con, attention from gay guys when you're straight as an arrow. ",

This came when I was becoming more confident in who I was and how I wanted to look and dress too.\n\n**Pros**: obvious - people pay you mind in many ways. You can strike up conversations, friendships, etc. with strangers quite easily. The ego boosts that come from strangers admiring you rarely gets old.\n\nThe occasional free/discounted drink at bars from smiling, flirty bartenders is awesome. I also feel, as someone in an academic area, people seem more drawn to the confidence / charisma that goes with male attractiveness. \n\n**Cons**: the pressure to feel like you've always got to look good is frustrating. I never leave home without being very aware of how I'm dressed / styled. The attention, while nowhere near as unwanted as even an average looking girl, is sometimes annoying. Especially looking good and kind of weird / different - random people will touch me or interrupt whatever I'm doing almost every day.\n\nThis isn't an isolated negative, but tied in my depression / mental health issues, I'll sometimes fall into the spiral of thinking compliments and attention to my physicality erase the internalised worth I've established for who I feel I am as a person, which leaves me feeling empty and miserable sometimes. \n\n",

So once I lost the frizzy hair and extra chin, I was not only very attractive to others but also mildly interesting.\n\nBeing an attractive girl in my twenties, people generally assume that I enjoy anything popular, and I think I get extra praise for that not being the case. When it comes up, most guys are ecstatically impressed when they find out I don't like pop music or chick flicks. Also my love of geeky things is usually very well received. \n\nThe obvious pros: lots of positive attention, free drinks, free stuff, free admission to concerts/clubs, I think I meet people more easily, and I don't have to work very hard to get dates/hang out with people. \n\nA big con is how often I have unpleasant interactions with strangers. \"Hey girl, you fine. Ever been with a black man?\" Etc. while I'm minding my own business. This is everywhere btw. The gym, sidewalks, grocery stores, basically anywhere I am there's a sleazy guy trying to get in my pants. It's wildly unpleasant. I also sometimes have a hard time figuring out which guys are real friends and which ones are only pretending to be to try and get in my panties. \n\nAlso when guys treat me like a precious delicate flower. Sometimes it's nice and well received but in most situations I want to be treated as an equal. Such as when we're playing a competitive game like Avalon or Smash.

They would then go over, essentially, the who's who of those considered attractive, unattractive, and social pariahs. I had slipped somewhere between the second and third group back in grade 2, and because this information was heavily a popularity contest crossed with handed down tradition I never moved in that ranking. \n\nI didn't go to college, but once I got out into the workforce I suddenly got a lot of attention I didn't know how to handle.

She would be gazing longingly at him and then notice me watching her stare at my husband and then look away, and then 10 seconds later she's back at it haha. So we pay and get up to leave and I asked if he wanted go say bye to drunk girl. \"It would be rude to leave without at least getting her name, we basically had dinner with her. Aw come on, she really likes you, don't be mean to her!\" Heheheh he hates it. It entertains me too easily. ",

But now whenever a girl hits on my husband, I just look around at whatever good looking guy is within eyesight and ask him if he thinks that guy is into him too. My husband doesn't care either way, but it makes me feel better anyway since he reacts the same to guys or girls even though he's straight, so i feel secure he's all right with his life choices.

You know how when you're a kid, you see all the age 25+ people and you assume since they're adults surely they have life figured out and are mature, responsible huamns? Then as you start to get older, you realize more and more that a lot of these people have no idea what they're doing and you notice they make all kinds of terrible life choices? That's pretty much how dating is too.\n\nThere's going to be some stuff that gives you anxiety and makes you nervous, that's unavoidable but just from reading one of post of yours and seeing that you can be both introspective and honest with yourself, you're on a good path. \n\nUltimately you want to find someone you're attracted to and compatible with, so continue to be honest about what you want, what works and what doesn't, and encourage whoever you're seeing to give you feedback on things they think would help improve your relationship too. You can't fix something if one of the people isn't aware something is an issue right?\n\nThere will also still be plenty of people in their late 20s who are saying they have no idea how to be adults still so don't worry too much.\n",

Much less dated or did couply stuff like hold hands, or even kiss.\n\nI was also a very ugly teenager with no confidence and no idea how to present myself. I went through a similar thing where I had to discover - between the ages of 20 and 25 - how to dress, how to do my hair, how to wear makeup, etc. This past year was the first year when I felt like I was close to passing as a \"normal\" woman. I'm still not great looking, and the confidence is still a problem, but I'm not super ugly either, and I take good care of myself, which definitely helps. \n\nI too had the \"what now?\" moment, when I finished my protracted personal makeover and realized I had NO IDEA how to date. I had kissed two guys and had sex with one, but in both cases it was rather reluctant on my part, more an act of \"better get this over with and learn how to do it\" than an act of passion. So I had some pretty negative feelings about dating, and I totally empathize with feeling lost. \n\nI found that the thing that helped me the most was just going out on dates. I used online dating and challenged myself to just go on some \"first dates,\" without over-thinking things, without expecting perfection, and with the notion in mind that I was in control and could jump ship whenever I wanted. The great thing about online dating is that you can make it clear in your profile that you have no experience in relationships, and weed out the guys who have a problem with that. I went out a few times, and each time it got easier. A few months ago I went on a date with someone who I definitely thought was \"out of my league\" - both intellectually and in the looks department - and we really hit it off. And here's the thing: he's a normal guy, and he didn't edge away from me, even when he began to discover just how awkward I am about dating. Turns out, there are men out there who were \"ugly ducklings\" as well - men who had a similar journey as you and I and feel just as lost in all of this. Neither of us knows what we are doing, and it is great. I won't pretend it isn't awkward or uncomfortable at times, trying to navigate things, but dating is always going to be awkward and uncomfortable for various reasons - even for those who are \"good at it.\"\n\nAnyways, I thought you might find that encouraging. I won't pretend that I have any advice, besides keep doing what you are doing and don't discount the men who are also a little lost.\n\nps: I wrote this as a reaction to the person who suggested lying. That was probably a joke, but nobody should feel the need to lie about their dating history. Besides being morally questionable, it doesn't work well anyways...",

While that's true, it's also a bit of an oversimplification. Communication - particularly of the verbal variety - relies on three different elements for effectiveness. Those elements are as follows:\n\n\\- The tone and mannerisms you use while speaking.    \n\\- The words themselves.    \n\\- Any biases or assumptions held by the listener.\n\nMost people are intimately aware of how the first and second details can affect an exchange. The third one isn't exactly a secret, either, but it's often approached in a way that's ultimately detrimental.\n\nLet's use my above scenario as an example.\n\n------\n\n**WOMAN:** I am expressing interest in conversing with you.    \n**ME:** I am responding with interest of my own. May I purchase a beverage for you?    \n**WOMAN:** I anticipated your offer, and I am going to decline without rejecting you.    \n**ME:** I am going to foolishly fixate on the beverage aspect of this conversation, as opposed to your interest.    \n**WOMAN:** I am concerned that your previous compliment was just politeness. If you are truly interested in conversing, please accompany me to an environment that is more conducive to it.    \n**ME:** Being that I am an idiot, I am going to continue fixating on the beverage question, and inform you of this with a negative response.    \n**WOMAN:** I am beginning to feel hurt by what I perceive to be either rudeness or entitlement. I am also disappointed that my initial impression of you as a prospective mate has been rendered apparently inaccurate.    \n**ME:** Sputtering protocol engaged.    \n**WOMAN:** My displeasure is now visible, but as I have yet to leave, my presence should inform you that I am holding out some last vestiges of interest.    \n**ME:** Initiating croaking sequence.    \n**WOMAN:** Goodbye.\n\n------\n\nIn short, I spent the entire exchange focusing on the wrong detail, even though that was the apparent purpose of the conversation. By adding a negative element to what *looked* like a lack of interest (or even a lack of empathy), I painted myself as being a rather aloof and unapproachable individual, and I wound up making everything worse by stumbling over my own tongue.\n\nNow, I don't know your precise situation with your mother, but it sounds to me like she's expecting more than just a to-the-letter following of her instructions. When she says \"I want you to change your tone,\" what she likely *means* is \"I want to feel like you genuinely care about me.\" She (and you) might focus on the specific detail, but it's the underlying desire that's actually important. Rather than just listening to your mother's directions and meeting her demands, try asking about those core emotions. When you offer reassurance, make an attempt addressing the need itself, not just its symptom.\n\nIt won't always work (hell, it can even cause a few more fights), but the effort and attention will go a long way.\n\nAs another example, here's how my exchange *should have* gone:\n\n------\n\n**WOMAN:** I am expressing interest in conversing with you.    \n**ME:** I am responding with interest of my own. May I purchase a beverage for you?    \n**WOMAN:** I anticipated your offer, and I am going to decline without rejecting you.    \n**ME:** I will now invite you to a different location of this establishment.    \n**WOMAN:** I accept your invitation, and will now insinuate that copulation between us is a possibility.    \n**ME:** Sputtering protocol engaged.\n\n------\n\n**TL;DR: Ask what the core emotion behind any exchange might be, and you'll be a better communicator.**",

It's been a year since I've started and here's what I've managed to change:   \n   \n- Instead of looking to the side or to the ground I look people straight in the eye. Laser eye contact!   \n- I can approach people without over analyzing every little thing I'm going to say to them.   \n- When I'm talking to people I don't shake anymore and look like I'm dying inside. I give them a big ol' nice smile!      \n   \nI still have a lot to learn but I'm getting better. Easier said than done? Ha! It's literally just willpower, the willpower to take action and break out of your comfort zone. The first time I went up to a random stranger to talk with them it was super awkward, but I don't regret it. Because it's those awkward conversations which got me to where I am now.   \n   \n**TL;DR** Buck up, take action, and have the willpower to succeed through failure.",

Then just listening and asking follow up questions.  \n\nAlso, and I know this is hugely discouraged in some circles, but buying a drink for the other person is not a bad way to get a couple minutes to make a good impression.

I scrub when I'm in the shower and pop any pimples that rise to the surface but I've just kind of come to terms with being ugly.",

And most times if you have cystic, you have a ton of vulgaris to go along with it.  And it's the kind of vulgaris that keeps coming back in the same exact spot no matter how much you scrub.\n\nThe only solution I've found to both vulgaris and cystic is, as odd as it may sound, an off-the-shelf hair growth formula.  I'm not kidding.  I met the CEO of the company that makes it, got some samples and it works.  It doesn't take care of everything, but it gets the bulk of it.",

We don't have any political parties, and our issues aren't stuff like starting a trade war, it's how to fund a new high school and bitching about the ferry operator.\n\nI've been living in Singapore (a big country :P) for the last few months and nobody here has heard of it. I have to show it to them on the map, or lie and say I'm from the UK. And inevitably when I do show it to them I have to explain that no we're not part of the UK, yes I'm a British citizen, it says European Union on my passport, but we're not part of the EU, but I stand to lose my rights to live in it, thanks Britain, and we don't have an army but the British are supposed to defend us and we've only been invaded once in 1940 but they didn't then bla bla bla\n\nNaturally it's a very close-knit community.

Being in a small island community hasn't made my social circle any larger or smaller. You do end up knowing a lot of people nearly everywhere you go, but that same phenomena occurs in small city in the United States all the time. In general, the culture and interests we share as a people makes everywhere you go feel very welcoming. \n\nAnd  most people don't know this, but Fiji is made up of over 300 islands, so the amount of exploring in completely empty, near perfect islands you can do is endless :) ",

This manifests itself in a weird way:\n\nI'm a big gym goer and in London I see it all the time that people just walk off leaving weights lying around and not cleaning up after themselves. Maybe partially because here they're one in a very big crowd, nobody will know who didn't unload that barbell. \n\nIn Estonia however the gyms are much more orderly: people always take their weights off and put things back and I think it's to do with it being more easily visible if you're acting like a douche. \n\nAnonymity breeds douchebaggery, familiarity counteracts it.

There's little reason to set high tariffs for stuff that'll be imported anyway. (yes, big exceptions such as Singapore cars, etc.)\n+ Geography and history is easier since there isn't dozens of states or counties to learn about.\n\nCons:\n\n+ You will *have* to vacation out of the country. Could be a pro I guess if you have a passport as good as Singapore's, but other smaller countries might not have such luck.\n+ Limited life choices domestically. It's not feasible to be a rancher in Singapore, neither is it to be a rocket scientist in Brunei. If your aspirations aren't found locally, you'll have to move.\n\nDepends:\n\n+ You'll see familiar faces very frequently. Some people like it, some don't.\n+ Healthcare. Singapore has really good access to healthcare (costs aside), but for less dense Brunei, people do get airlifted overseas for critically urgent procedures.\n+ Public transport. In Brunei due to low density it hardly exists, while Singapore has one of the better ones in the world.\n\nThat's it for now unless I come up with some more.",

Children as young as 8 within it have attempted to commit suicide.  \n\nIt's not 'Australia's Guantanamo', since Guantanamo doesn't contain suicidal children. It's worse.

If the roads allowed travel above an average speed of 30km/hr one would be able to drive from the boarder of Benin to Ghana in less than in hour. If the roads were modern one would be able to drive from the northernmost point to the southernmost point in 7 hours.\n\nThe reality is, however that travelling here sucks. It is dangerous and expensive to the average Togolese citizen. Therefore, many people only rarely visit outside their cultural region. Because of this Togo feels like a much larger country culturally. (I'm coming from the midwest U.S). There are four or fave major cultures/languages that each have their own customs and distinct personalities. Also, because Togo is long and skinny, it has a few different climate zones, with the south being hot and humid but not rainy, the central part being more rainy and foresty, and the northenmost part being dry savannah. People here understand Togo is small because they have been told so, and they've seen maps. But the majority of people will never fully grasp the vastness of the U.S. or the world. \n\nIt's hard to state the advantages or disadvantages of it being small because it's an underdeveloped West African nation, so there are mostly just disadvantages. I will say that it's really neat to be able to drive for three hours and arrive in a place that has a different climate, culture, language, food, and resources than the place you left. Almost everything else i can think of is a challenge or a disadvantage. \n\n*Sidenote: Among the foreign worker crowd, we share info on all the places to eat, of which there are few. So I'm vaguely aware of the majority of passable restaurants in the entire country. Also there are only two public swimming pools in the country outside of the capital, so once when going on a first date at a swimming pool I randomly ran into other Americans/Europeans I knew. It turned out alright because the date turned into a public relationship, but there was a moment where i was worried about fielding questions about my love-life from half the foreign workers in the country.

Cutting to the chase...\n\n# Quick description\n[Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar) is a hunk of rock in the south of [Andaluc\u00eda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia), facing Ceuta (a Spanish enclave in Africa) and Morocco. It was ceded to the British a few hundred years ago by Spain, who would love to take it back - something which Gibraltarians have always opposed. You can drive around the Rock in less than 20 minutes and you've pretty much seen nearly everything. Gibraltar, like the UK, is not part of Schengen, which means that there is a proper frontier between the countries, much to the dismay of the thousands of crossborder workers who commute every day from Spain.\n\n# Pros\n* 300+ sunny days per year\n* Low income tax (average of 22%)\n* Low corporate tax (10%)\n* No sales tax (VAT)\n* Little to no daily life stress\n* Virtually non-existent crime\n* Awesome place to raise kids of all ages\n* Free healthcare\n* Free public transportation, but not for non-residents\n* Free education, including University, fully paid by the Gibraltar government if you study in British Territories\n* High salaries for skilled jobs - much higher than in Spain, nearly comparable to London\n* Cheaper labour is hired from Spain for McJobs, with higher wages * this is quite a relief for the Spanish living in the region\n\n# Cons\n* The place is cramped up and induces claustrophobia\n* Village mentality. You do something, the whole Rock will know. Mind who you date, and more importantly, who you shag.\n* Deliveries from outside the country (*read: 99.99999999% of the planet, including the UK itself*) are charged 6% import tax. The tax itself is not a problem, but your packages will be physically held at the customs office, so you need to go there to pay the fee and receive your order. It can be a pain.\n* There are 1.5 cars per inhabitant - nearly no parking spaces, **heavy** pollution\n* The power grid is highly unstable\n* Tensions between Spain and UK destroy any common sense, such as purchasing electricity from Spain to avoid blackouts. Instead, power is generated locally by burning copious amounts of fossil fuels (*pollution again!*)\n* **Controversial opinion:** a lot of ugly people. Not necessarily in raw appearance, but dressing style leaves a lot to be desired. Definitely a British territory. I'm an aesthete, sorry. Deal with it.\n\n\nThe ideal situation, which I am happy to enjoy as I speak, is to be a resident in Gibraltar, work in IT/Finance and actually live in Spain, where you can purchase a Villa with a private pool for the price of a two bedroom shoebox on the Rock. Commuting can be a bitch some days, but the quality of life resulting from enjoying a high salary and pay low Spanish prices is simply priceless.",

People didn't live in houses, they lived in small efficiency type of places.  Some lived in houses but they were small.   And people shared *everything*.  In kibbutz culture they will treat you like family - unlike here in the US, where no one gives a crap about their neighbors.  A kibbutz will have their own shops, bars, schools, zoos even.  Some are more agricultural and some are more modern.  If you live in a kibbutz and you're in need of money or a job, they will do anything they can to help \n\nYou have people from all over the world.  It's not uncommon to find people who speak 4-8 languages \n\nThe food is great, and you have such huge variances in culture.  Jerusalem will be more religious and you have huge pieces of history, and then you go to tel aviv and it's all city, all modern, busy, lots of nightlife \n\nThe disadvantages are that there are a lot of people who hate the country, who want the country to cease to exist.  And then when you read about something in the media that portrays the country and military in a bad light, it's even worse - especially when you know that what's being said isn't true.

Our medical system isn't bad but we can't justify a lot of expensive modern high tech equipment in the hospital because we don't enough patients to effectively net out the cost. So we have to send people to Denmark/Sweden for treatment for certain types of cancer and surgeries. A lot of infrastructure is lacking for the same reason.\n\nLow population density means our schools are tiny. In america your average high school has a gym, a swimming pool, an orchestra and several sports teams. In a school with 300-400 kids it's impossible to organize a decent sports team or anything alike.\n\nThe tiny economy and small number of people means insane fluctuations in currency, inflation and housing prices with very little warning. In a market like the US, Germany or the UK, inflation takes many months to ramp up because an economy at that scale can't turn on a dime. In Iceland, it can.\n\nThere's very little manufacturing, due to a combination of the small scale of things and the isolation of the country. It's difficult to import/export stuff. And anything imported costs 30-40% more than in the rest of mainland europe, because you have to account for the shipping cost (which also has VAT added on top of it.. and did I mention we used to hold the world record for highest VAT?)",

I'm from Canada and it takes 24 hours of driving just to get to the next province over. I loved Luxembourg \n\nedit: to clarify. It's 2100 km for me to get to MB border. It's about a day of travel with gas, food, bathroom stops, small rest break, the usual stuff. Those northern roads are brutal, especially at night. You can speed, but I'd rather not get dead from moose or giant potholes that pop tires like the last time I went. But yes, technically it is doable under 24 hours. ",

Certainly it would make sense that this would be a compounding factor for an obesity problem.\n\nI also have understood that the economy is fucked because their money was squandered by some hotel tycoon. The riches they had amassed were supposed to be put in some type of trust that would invest in a hotel development.  The trust was rife with corruption and later collapsed. It was supposed to be the future of Nauru... Instead the failed trust left the people of Nauru with... a big pile of dug up bird shit. \n\nNauru is a sad place and an unmistakable lesson for the future of our race.\n\nThis is one of the many documentaries I have watched during my 'Nauru fascination phase' that talks about the rise and fall of the Island.\n\n[Youtube ~20 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRl5ctx-S1M)",

It's a cigar smokers paradise. \nThe people have such integrity and respect for one another and your laws. \nIt's a model country for the rest of the world to follow in my opinion. \nAmazing country side and mountains of course. \nAnd lakes and rivers and water falls. \nAnd amazing trains. \nChocolate and cheese although the rest of your food kind of sucks. \nYour education system with its apprenticeship approach obviously works as you guys are so productive and skilled. \nI love CH. I really do. \nI hope to live there someday. \n\nI do understand the claustrophobic feeling you can get with all the mountains and your mostly horrible weather though, but it's so easy to drive, fly or take a train and get away for a few days. \nJust enough time to realize how crappy most people are in other countries so that you're always glad to come back to Switzerland. \n\nCheers!

One of the most noticeable thing is that argentineans use the \"voseo\" in language (meaning we use \"vos\"/\"ustedes\" instead of \"tu\"/\"vosotros\" for saying *you*) while uruguayans use a mix of voseo and normal spanish.\n\nYou see, on the river plate variation of spanish, both the world \"you\" and the verbs are conjugated with this \"voseo\" variation. Uruguayans use \"tu\" (standard spanish world) but conjugate the verbs with voseo, resulting in an funny and strange language, but you get used to it pretty quickly.\n\nBesides that, there are a lot of differences in culture, diet and products. Hoestly I like the places I've visited in Uruguay a lot more than Argentina\n\nA lot of argentinians joke saying uruguay is \"the rebel province\", but the reality is that there is a hell of a difference just between uruguay and Entre Rios (the argentinian province that limits with uruguay, separated by the river)",

It has a 50% tax - just think of US gas prices and roughly doubles it. A gallon sells right now for about $4.\n\nBuying soap, deodorant, toilet paper, shampoo...? These are considered \"luxury items\" and pay a luxury items tax. Yes, as well as cars. Want a TV? 49% tax. Beer, rice, chicken, dairy products? These are in hands of monopolies that nobody questions. You'll find the same goods from these products in other countries for about half the price. Yes, I've the seen the local beer for about half the price in Florida. \n\nFood? We have a protectionist state / laws that place taxes on anything not grown here. Have a nice house? There's another tax - on top of you regular annual municipal tax. Buying anything? There's a 13% sales tax... That depending on the nature of the item, will have additional ones. \n\nDecent internet, let's say 20 Mbps? That'll be $60.\n\nA good rule of thumb for practically everything that's imported: take the US price tag and multiply it by 2.\n\nTo cut it short, there are more than 100 active taxes. Enjoy!",

Yes, traffic in Manila is a really serious problem, I don't think the government neglects the problem, they're just incompetent no matter what administration/president is in power.\n\nWell, to be fair, they did try to introduce some alternative solutions but almost none of it works well. People just don't want to deal with the bad public transportation we have here, so therefore they buy their own cars which deliberately results to further traffic congestion. And car salesmen that offer car deals in cheaper prices just accelerates the rate of increase of vehicles here.\n\nPersonally, while I also want to buy a car before I turn 30 or so, I don't plan on using it regularly as I am pretty adapted to public transportation here. I'm not saying that public transportation is convenient for me, I'm just pretty used to it and I can still handle it since I'm still pretty young.",
