My job often reminds me of [this scene in the office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yslB3BkDm8). People laugh at the things we mention, but anything we mention that you don't have to do has probably been attempted before. One of my co-workers said that a group started getting really destructive in the room, to the point where they literally threw the computer on the floor to see if something was hidden inside (there wasn't anything hidden inside, they need to use a special magnifying glass to read the monitor). We abruptly removed them from the room after that. They actually ended up coming back another day and were extremely well behaved. I guess they learned their lesson. ",

Some people put them between their legs, in the crack of their ass as a joke, and not to mention just roll around the ground a majority of the time. Besides that I've seen relationships almost fall apart. One couple insisted on going into our most challenging room just the two of them, and we let them know this was probably not going to be a good idea or enjoyable for them, but they didnt really care. You could tell the guy wanted to impress the girl, but both of them were dumber than rocks. I had to sit for an entire hour watching them get literally no where through the first puzzle arguing with each other and then sitting in moments of awkard silence. I offered to give them help and said i would just tell them if they wanted at this point, but they refused. Also people love to not listen to our disclosure we have to give before we send groups into rooms and kick in our air vents and break through our drywall and ceilings when we specifically say not to and put tape that says NOT A PART OF THE GAME in bright yellow colors",

My favorite quote is from a lovely family that went into a room and 5 minutes in the father gathered his overeager children and told them \"you're being assholes\". We're in a huge tech area and we get a lot of corporate groups with some very important people. A week ago we had a Fortune 500 CEO through and he walked up to my staff and started bragging about his 50,000 Instagram followers, basically trying to impress college kids. We definitely giggled about that one especially when we looked him up and he had like 300 followers. But hey, he killed it in the room! ",

(Yes, literally had guys hit on THE FUCKING ZOMBIE mid show). Perhaps the most interesting phenomenon I noticed was just how much personality factors into the teamwork involved. I've seen a lot of shy people or people otherwise lacking in confidence be completely on the right track, only to be steamrolled by the loudest, more confident, strongest personalities in the room. Maybe it shouldn't have come as so much of a surprise, but I watched perfectly smart, reasonable people actively ignore good points, logic, and strong evidence in service of a cult of personality of charismatic players. The whole thing felt like a depressing study on group dynamics. ",

The room was separated into two sections like a normal bank is, the customer area (where you normally go when you enter the bank) & the banker area (where you go when you are a bank employee). Wellll..... the two areas are separated by a wall type fence thus resulting in about a foot of empty space between the end of the fence and the ceiling. You can probably tell where this is going. This group was stumped on how to solve the code on the door leading into the banker area so one goes, \"Can't we just climb the wall?\". I immediately sprung into action and frantically ding them over and over (There is a TV where you receive clues and when you hear the ding that means there is a new clue)... unfortunately this was a group of two different bookings so one group read the message but was too timid or didn't care to relay the \"DO NOT CLIMB\" message I was spamming them with. In about a second a man climbed the wall and got into the second part. I ended up having to open the door, go in and let him out. I think they all saw I was steaming because they apologized after. I told them I am just glad no one got hurt because that could have been reaaaaaaaaaaaally bad. **Also when a group of 10 year olds left me this gem:** http://imgur.com/a/4Tj2v ",

So far so good. We have cameras and microphones inside the rooms, that way we know what hints to give out, another important thing is that the room they were at had a small fountain, and since the particular aesthetic of this room was dusty, that water was filthy. I'm talking murky, brown-yellow, mud-water. At one point one of the guys says he is thirsty, and proceeds to stick his mouth onto the fountain's stream and take a hefty gulp of the shit-water. We spend a second of shock/guffaw, and tell them that drinking the fucking water isn't part of the puzzle. The guy reads the hint and just says \"that's alright\". He proceeded to do the same thing four times and drank the whole fountain (small fountain, but still like a gallon of mud-water).

Another one: Some guy was convinced something was hidden under a chair that was screwed to the floor, he started kicking it. Had to stop the game and go into the room to tell him he should stop doing that. One time a guy brought his own flashlight, had to tell him that is against the rules of the game. One time a guy ripped the green laser out of it's very secured spot in the room, had to stop the game and tell him to put it back. Had a girl freak out because of the music and got her out ASAP.

We were supposed to get the word Waterloo from a series of clues and use a dictionary to find that the battle of Waterloo was in 1815. Use that 4 digit number to get a key that let us out of the room. Well we got the word 'eaterloi' instead of Waterloo. We assumed that it was an anagram and we used a word scrambler to get the word aerolite from it. Using the dictionary we found that aerolite was invented in 1815. Well we got the key and we confidently told the employee how we figured it out. He was dumbfounded. I'm not exactly sure what the odds of solving the room like this is, but if someone could solve that for us that'd be dank. My friends and I have been trying to figure it out since it happened.",

Anyway, each cell is pretty much the same, with a toilet, shelf, and a few other items. One guy was pretty drunk and repeatedly put bones and other shit in his pants to get a laugh out of his teammates, but they stopped paying attention to him while trying to actually make their escape. He must've gotten bored being so drunk and not caring about the escape room, he leaves the main group and heads back to he prison cell area. I'm watching on the cameras and see he's not with the rest of the group, so I start clicking around trying to find him. Sure enough, he's in a jail cell hovering over a toilet, taking a piss. There's no plumbing, they're definitely just props. We shut their game down on the spot, his group was not happy with him at all. After they left I had the pleasure of soaking up his piss with a mop little by little, and it was after that night we added the \"anyone visibly intoxicated will not be allowed to participate\" rule.

When we got there, there were two other kids there, early teenagers from the looks of them, a little gawky and weird, but they seemed excited to be there and hey, maybe they'd help out. Then we get to the part where we have to give our names and they have apparently named themselves military ranks. Also they're saluting. Ok... that's weird. The person who brought them both was their aunt from the sounds of it, and she just sat there on her phone in the waiting room, looking pissed off that this was even happening. Over the course of the introductions it became increasingly apparent that these kids were severely on the spectrum and probably should not have been doing something like this without a full group of friends and family. Well, they got a family at least. My family. Anyways, we get in there, and it's pretty neat. There's a Zombie actor on a chain who will try and crawl at people and tag them. Every now and again, a buzzer sounds and she goes back into a room and the chain extends another few feet and she comes back. So you have to have zombie distractors (by singing) and puzzle solvers. Apparently though, our two sidekicks are absolutely terrified of zombies. They shrieked and pushed themselves up against the farthest wall possible. One of them pooped himself at some point. They spent the rest of the match cowering behind my mother who had become their unofficial mom. In the end I just ended up pissed off at their aunt who just sat on her phone in the waiting room the entire time, letting them be terrified. I can't imagine what would have happened if our family hadn't been there. I like to imagine the procter would've called it off and refunded them once he saw how utterly incapacitated they were. But they said they had a good time, and other than a few wafts of poo here and there, we did too. At the risk of going to hell, the whole thing was really funny in a 'I can't believe these series of events are happening' kind of way. Still furious about their aunt, but it's a story to share at least. It was a terrific evening, full of laughter, and my father's all time best 'dad' moment, when the zombie had my mom cornered and he stepped forwards, thrusting his finger at the actress and yelled \"HEY ZOMBIE, GET AWAY FROM MY WIFE!\". Somehow it worked.",

A room of ours has a one-hitter as past of our props, a lady attempted to steal it by slowly moving it out of sight as conspicuously as possible. We insinuated that their next clue was inside the bowl, and she left out of embarrassment after she surrendered it to her group. A customer opened a cryptex at the beginning of the game, figured out how the mechanism was set, the reset it to a secret word and closed it. I guessed PENIS, it was PENIS. Case closed.

One day a dude called and told us he was proposing to his girlfriend and that they were both huge fans of escaperooms. So my boss and came up with a cool idea how we could change our escaperoom to make it more romantic and that at the end of the escape they wouldn't find the key of the room but the ring and a bottle of champagne. We also told the dude the solutions of some of the puzzles to make sure they would actually come to the end of the room. It was the cutest thing I have ever seen. The way these two worked together in the room and how excited the dude was. When they found the ring and the champagne at the end and he asked to marry her, they were both in tears (So were my boss and I). She said yes! After that they stayed with us for a bit before heading their own way. It is still one of my favorite evenings and one of the reasons I love my newfound job so much. ",

I always feel bad for this reason, because a lot of the puzzles directly depend on English wordplay and stuff like that. But they seem to have fun just being with their kids, so we all have fun together. One time a family came in that seemed to fit this profile. I'm not sure which country of origin they had, but they seemed Asian-American to me. But I am an uneducated buffoon, so I couldn't tell you what language the parents spoke. They spoke very sparingly in their original language, and the children spoke in accented English. They went through the room, the children solving most of the puzzles, and the father following them around silently with a notepad and pen, nodding and writing things as they found clues. They got out, I took their picture, and they left, and everyone seemed to have had a good time. When we clean up the room, we have to rip several of the pages off from the notepad so people can't see the clues or even the indents of the clues people had written down from previous games. I was looking forward to seeing what language the father had been writing in the whole time. I reset the room, then get to the notepad, only to find [the first page in perfect English:](http://imgur.com/5TPNeno) \"What if we can't get out? Do we die in here? I burst out laughing, realizing this man was hilarious and I wanted to chase him down and take his family to lunch, then I flipped to [the next page:](http://imgur.com/TfGwdGd) \"Day 56 our rations are running low. We fear for our lives. We are thinking of cannibalism.\" It was my best experience working there and I'll never forget it as long as I live. My racist ass got owned in the funniest, most heartwarming way possible. *TL;DR I assumed a man didn't speak English but he had written a whole hilarious journal in English in the notepad and now I'm a better person.

I have no idea, but it happens a lot. It was a girl's 21st birthday and everyone was drunk, but she was plastered. She ended up lying on the floor and not moving, and we didn't know if she was okay, so we send someone in to check on her and she said she was just resting and laughed it off. Later, the same girl laughed so hard that she fell down and pissed all on the floor. 2) One guy had dip in his mouth and decided to spit in the corner of the room instead of in his bottle. 3) One lady completely threw up in a room and they all just kept laughing. When asked if she was okay by my coworker, she responded with, \"oh, I just throw up when I get really excited!!\" 4) Two guys were doing a room and thought the next step they needed to do \"looked gay\" so they ended up sitting down on the floor and staring around (since you aren't allowed to have your phone) for the last 30 minutes of the room. Edit: I can't give away too much because of my employee agreement, but it had to do with blowing on something in the room. I think it was more funny because of the fact that they wouldn't do it because of their pride, rather than it actually *looked gay*. 5) We've also had a lot of marital arguments and tests of friendship that do NOT end well. Side note: whatever you do, NEVER do an escape room for a first date. You'll more than likely have a group of strangers with you and it's also just super awkward all around. On a brighter note, we've had some proposals in our escape rooms! If I think of some more, I'll edit this post. Edit 2: There was a proposal one time near the end of the room where instead of kissing they shook hands and kept on doing the room. Edit 3: I don't know HOW I forgot this story because it's the best one! If a group doesn't show up 10 minutes before their start time, we call to ask if they're making their way or not. Well this guy put his home phone number and when we called, his wife answered, but she had no idea what we were talking about. We asked for her name and she wasn't on any booking information, so we assumed it was a wrong number. Well the husband shows up with A DIFFERENT FAMILY. She seemed to be his girlfriend by the way they flirted in the room, and she also had kids. Then, when they escaped, he refused to have his picture taken. We called that event, \"the night of Affair Guy.\" Edit 4: New employee's first day happened to be a Saturday night. The lady in the room lifted her shirt and flashed the camera for the new guy and the trainer to see. Later she comes out of the room and said, \"wait, is someone really watching us on the camera?\" Edit 5: It's also REALLY easy to see your thong through your too-tight leggings on a night vision camera...",

I've seen people rip outlets out of walls (we had to warn them not to stick keys in), dismantle furniture and electronics, pull vent covers off the air ducts, physically bend back file cabinet drawers to get around the lock. They'll write all over all the clues, even deliberately go against the rules you set because they think you were trying to trick them. We had a group reset the password on our computer so we had to wipe it and reinstall everything (lesson learned for the game makers, always have an admin account!). A woman decided to throw--literally throw--every non-clue glass object into a trash can, leaving me with 10 minutes to reset the room AND clean up a mountain of broken glass. A favorite was \"She said not to use the fire extinguisher unless there's a fire... and this says 'Warning, flammable!'\" But the weirdest thing is the waves of groupthink*. It's noticeable to everyone, my boss even warned me about it my first day. A meaningless picture might be hanging on the wall, completely ignored by every group for months, until suddenly you have a wave of 10 groups in a row who take it off the wall and dismantle it because they've become convinced it means something. They'll drawn new conclusions from a note that have never been drawn before, and the game makers never intended. They'll follow the same, incorrect process for solving a puzzle that we haven't seen before, or make the same arithmetic/decryption errors. They'll MISREAD things the same way, even mishear audio clues the same way (as in, repeat the same nonsense words to describe what they heard). They'll physically destroy the same props, locks, or set pieces game after game. And then it will stop, and no one will do that thing again for months. Maybe it's confirmation bias, maybe it's little factors like how I deliver my speech that day or the weather... I don't know. But it is undeniably weird. Edit: *holy fucking shit this took off. I've been called out for incorrectly using the word \"groupthink\", so please consider it used here to describe \"waves of many people doing the same very odd thing.\"",

A lot of what people have already mentioned; Taking off / putting on the clothes in the room, trying to eat things in the room ( both things they brought and things they found ) trying to punch holes in the walls and climb into the cielings...Cut up the carpet, convince themselves that they're still 'IN THE ROOM' after they've finished ( still looking for puzzles and stuff ) but more often than not the 'weird' stuff is related to demographic / religious circumstances or issues. Stuff like the hyper-catholic hispanic family that took one step into the room with the ouija board puzzle and then instantly sprinted out of the room and demanded a refund. Really, it's a lot of religious stuff. When I started the job, my manager was like, \"You've got to be extra careful with the jews.\" At first I thought he was being a real fucker. But it turns out that 90% of our customer base are full on Hacidic or otherwise orthodox jewish families. We don't know why, perhaps, as a tight-knit community, we're just deep into a chain of personal recommendations. Regardless, they are lovely people, but they've many proclivities. A jewish couple will come in and explain that they can't be locked in a room together for religious purposes ( A man and a woman that aren't married can't be alone in a room together ) so we need to come in and 'check' on them every few minutes. I'll explain, hey, you're on camera the whole time and never *locked* in, but it won't do. I've often wondered if the couples we frequently have are there out of some sort of perverse fascination with being FORCED to be locked in a room with one another. Otherwise, why choose to do something that is so antithetical to the rules of their religion? One such couple actually proposed to each-other in the room, and then just sort of smiled and barely touched each other. They came out all smiles saying they were so thrilled to be engaged but like, not enough to touch one another I guess. (Edit: As /u/ittsbitts points out, just as the couples are not allowed to be in a room together, they are also not allowed to touch one another until marriage. An aspect of hacidicism I frequently and painfully forget! You'd think I'd have learned by now, after trying many, many times to high-five an orthodox jewish woman post-escape and getting left hanging in the worst way.) Proposals in general can be weird. Often they go great, but, ultimately the people NEED to get out, so that they can find the ring hidden in the end. Even if they're not doing well, they need to escape. That circumstance is always a bummer - It'll be two people, just the couple. Only the guy is completely freaking out the whole time about having to pop the question at the end, so, the girl ends up dragging the guy through the whole thing, doing all the work - Or, worse, we give them all the answers after an hour of standing around - All to reveal this ring at the perfect moment, only, that moment is completely ruined by this newfound perspective you have on your fiance, as this completely bumbling idiot who didn't solve one fucking puzzle the whole time Otherwise I get a lot of weird solutions from individuals based on the strange shit they bring in the room. There's one puzzle that requires you to use a thermal imaging camera - Well, our buddy skipped that because he just so happened to have one with him. That's pretty extreme, otherwise it's just a bunch of magnets they have or knowing morse code when the room expects them to find a translation sheet...IDK, there's a billion things. I'll try to remember some more specifics. Edit: More stories! We have a corporate group rate; large business groups can have all their employees come in and team up to get out. Only, our location specializes in private events; that means that if you come with just one other person you can have the room to yourselves. This means the rooms are small. If we have a big corporate group, we'll split the group into teams of 8, and have all the groups start at once and try to get out of seperate rooms, to 'see who gets out first'. Only the rooms are all very different - Entirely seperate sets of puzzles, each testing very different types of thinking. Sounds fun! Only, having your whole office split into teams and then see who's the 'best' at objectively different tests can lead to some really cringey situations. You'll have one group of 8 get out two minutes before another group of their co-workers, who is also just about to get out - and then, every time, without fail, a group of buttoned up CEOs and their co-workers, all in their 50's, suddenly degenerate into shrieking teenagers, banging on the doors to the other room and shouting through the walls about how they're losers. Worse yet is when one corporate group will escape and another will not - The gloating is so goddamned cringey. Talk about \"team building\"... Also, one of our rooms has a CPR dummy in it. You're meant to take an endoscopy camera and stick it down his throat to find a puzzle. The things people have done to that poor guy...and with that endoscopy camera. In their mouths, in their butts, in the walls, in the electrical sockets...they have stuck that camera anywhere you can think of. ",

I've seen two different couples literally break up in one of my escape rooms. I've seen a full grown man push over his nephew to open the final the door (He thought he was going to break the room record... he was 15 minutes off) One of our rooms has a hidden Ring box in it which has caused many mini-heart attacks. Couple attempted to have sex in a corner they thought I couldn't see on the camera Two Chinese parents brought their 3 children to our escape room and yelled at them for an hour because the kids \"weren't smart enough to break the record\". The parents didn't help at all they stood in the corner and literally yelled at all 3 children. Baby shower in our escape room Same guy brought multiple tinder dates to our escape room and did the same room every time so he knew all the answers. He always payed and He never tried to break the record so I let it slide. The girls were always so impress with him. Teenagers climbed though the ceiling tiles Group gets so drunk in the room that half of them passed out and had to kick them out Mom drops her kids off like it's a daycare and expects me to \"keep them busy\" for two and a half hours during a one hour escape room... at 10pm The best group I've ever seen inside my room was a family of stoners. Mom, dad, son, sons gf, and daughter. All reeked of weed coming into the building. They had 90% of the room solved in about 15 minutes and I was freaking out. Even called my boss and I remember saying \"I have 5 stoners about to break the record by 20 minutes\". But then all of the sudden all 5 got burnt out. They sat in a circle and talked to each other for about 45 minutes in the middle of the room. They took 1 hour and 15 minutes to finish. I feel like I could write a book about my experience working at an escape room. It was the most fun I've ever had at a job but at the same time I was so stressed out every time I was there. 10/10 would work there again. Edit: words",

You'd be surprised how many older black ladies make jokes about being turned on by it as I'm putting them in handcuffs. I've also seen a group of kids one time who couldn't figure out how to open a door in the room, so this kid winds up and kicks it open which busts the frame. One woman tried sticking her car keys into an outlet because she thought that would tell her something. The funniest moment was probably when I had a group of 8 police officers who were seriously jacked, like veins popping out of their eyeballs muscular. The room that they played had a startling event and when they triggered it every single one of these guys jumped up and screamed like little girls it was hilarious. I've had a drunk woman threaten to kick me in the balls if they didn't break out, which they didn't. She didn't end up following through though thank god. Oh man there was one time that I had been there for 10 hours and a group was playing a room with a locked door as the main focus of the first half, and I kind of stopped watching the screen for a few minutes only to look back and see that they had used a handcuff key to remove the door hinges and took it off the frame. I couldn't really do anything at that point so I just kind of had to let them continue. I'm sure there's more, I'll edit it in if I remember! Also excuse any formatting problems I'm on mobile.",

Naturally, we declined to offer any answers and he sulked to his girlfriend, who was encouraging his dumb request but oh, that's too bad babe. Another time, a couple wanted us to help them announce their pregnancy to friends by putting up a \"We're Pregnant!\" poster in one of the rooms (we had multiple rooms per escape zone). It'd be cute if the LED screen with a hand-drawn baby carriage wasn't in a Satanic themed escape room. It was a hit though so... /shrugs My third memory is that during a particularly busy weekend, I had a group pre-book several zones in advance for a big group of 10-15 people. They arrived from another city in a limo with matching t-shirts, announcing that they've \"conquered\" their city and that they're here to conquer Toronto.

The room was brand new, it had just openend to the public and we were one of the first non-test groups to play it. One of the items we had unlocked was a box out of which came two wires, each of them terminated with a banana plug (http://imgur.com/a/F7Aja). A while later, in a second part of the room, another member of the group noticed a power outlet (http://imgur.com/a/588iJ) which seemed to have some marks. They looked a bit like \"+\" and \"-\" signs. You can probably guess where this is going. I was cautious about the situation, and so was the other member who pointed out the socket to me. She said to the operator: \"so, we're going to stick those plugs in the power outlet, please say something now if that isn't what you're supposed to do\". They said nothing. I figured since it was there, had \"+\" and \"-\" marks on it and the operator didn't stop me after being warned, it was what you were supposed to do and it would be 5 or 12V or something, not the usual 230V. I put the plugs in the outlet. There was a spark. The room went dark. I basically killed the game right there.",

                    "body": "I created an escape in France with my wife, and we have a few nice things that happened to us. A room we have settles in 1979 were you have to go in the appartment/hideout of a gang of bank robbers to find back something for the government (based on a real story happened in our city). Sincce we do have a time machine which is the starting point of our all our stories, we send time agents on duty for our clients. Here the government that want theses cold war informations back. - we had a wedding proposal for which we changed the story where the guy actually hired us to find back and object that was stolen to his parents. The wedding ring happened to be this family previous object. => really nice wedding proposal and moment - in this mission, they are books. We made them casual and numerous so it is quite obvious no hidden info are on one random book there: on players spent most of the game to not participate anything but carefully look all over the books if something was strange. He was looking two things: if the page numbers were in order, and if a letter was not circled in a book. Even with multiple very straight forward clues, he did not wanted to stop because maybe the clues could be false leads. - as you could imagine, often and despite contrary briefing rules, people break things, including ceiling (in case some paper inside), wooden floor, write on the wall so everybody can see all info (despite white papers available). One time, someone litterally told us: \"it's ok, it's easy to change\" after breaking a furniture door to see what's inside. - we have on a mission a high, thin furniture, a big like those big old wood clock (I don't know the english name). A key is visible at the bottom and you have to fish it with cable and a magnet. On family wanted to pull there 5 yo boy inside, hanging by the feet: dangerous as hell ! - Some players really look at strange, weird, overkilled theories to solve some challenges while it is actually the easiest part of the game. They sometimes are really insistive for us to say it was reaaaallly hard just so that players have no chances. - One day, we had the worst group ever. Well just as we have the best record for the room, you have to get the worst right ! They made about 10% of the game with help. By the end, and because we want them to see the full story, we help them like \"good, you found this information, our machine can compute the code, it's xxx, now you just have to [explain litterally how]. When the family left, the father told me \"really, not everyone can go through ? This seems so easy!\" hum... yes sure ! you were the best ! - We have in one of our room a safe that is written on \"max three tries before definitely locked\". You have about 12 similar object with codes that are obviously for the safe and you must determine the correct one. One day, a player tried randomly three out of them. After the safe locked, we had to unlocked it for them to continue. The player immediatly tried out three other ones. The safe locked again. Second manual intervention to unlock it. The player tried another one code and open the safe. At the endd of the game, I came back to it, to offer showing how to get the proper code. Answer: \"not need, I found it. It was quite easy actually.\" I pointed out randomly was not how it was meant: \"I did not made randomly, I made it by elimination. It's a pretty easy strategy\". Ohoh, did I mention it was the same player then the previous one ?!! The thing I hate the most is when players get out of the room and because they did not succeed in some part are really insistive in saying: \"ok so we agree this [obviously some props requiring days of work] stuff was totally useless ?\". I sometimes don't know how to let them know that they litteraly ask the solution clue instead of trying. My bad english (sorry for it) may sound like I am a hatefull personn. But really I really love my players and our missions. We do create the missions, the stages decor and every props ourself with my wife with all our heart. We do also mostly have marvellous players, and we have great post-game conversations, some times even quite long !",

Edit: I'll add a few wholesome stories to this We've seen a few proposals in our rooms. I've also had kids do a better job than their parents. The adults over-complicate things. We've had many company parties as well. Definitely host your next company party at one of these places. Believe it or not, the employees at Uber (corporate) were by far the nicest group of people. The best part was hosting private parties. The amount of food left over could feed an entire hungry village. So much food Edit 2: I would love to take this opportunity to say FUCK ESCAPE ROOM LIVE in DC. They promoted me to private events manager then a week later took it away because they didn't need it anymore. I proceeded to put my two weeks in, they couldn't find anyone else to cover, and they closed down our beautiful little place temporarily. This caused a lot of college kids to lose their jobs.

In our prison style escape room we have a laser maze that players need to crawl/climb through to deactivate and move forward. Two players are required to finish (or so I thought) the laser maze because there are 3 buttons to be pressed, where the third button is out of reach from the other two. A family came in to play our game with a younger boy, a very fit (relevant) girl in her early twenties, their parents, and their grandfather who had some disability that required him to use those crutches that wrap around your forearms. So they play through and get to the laser maze. The girl got through fairly easily, but they needed to move fast since the timer was running. The young boy had a great idea, \"Here! Use grandpa's crutch!\" At which point he takes the crutch straight from grandpa and slides it past all the lasers to his sister at the other end. I was fascinated at this point but even with the crutch it was a long stretch to hit them all. The girl took a second to find the right spot on the floor, planted her foot there, went into a perfect perpendicular stretch with one foot on the ground, one foot on the far button, on hand on the middle button, and finally reaching the last button with the crutch. That family came out of the room so proud and she boasted to the family about her daily yoga, almost convincing me to sign up for yoga because it was so impressive. That was one of the most creative and weirdest successful solutions to a puzzle I've seen in my years working there.",

A lot of flowery language along the lines of \"You think you're *so smart? Then fucking figure it out yourself! I'm fucking done!\" Now, the room wasn't exactly soundproof, so me, my coworkers, and a few of our other customers heard the entire exchange. The couple didn't solve the room, but they came out smiling and acting like nothing had ever happened. It was a tad unsettling. 2) People have ripped the wall panelling out in one of our rooms on multiple occasions - exposed nails and everything - searching for clues. This probably happened at least once a month before we were able to bolt the panels down for good. 3) In that same room, we have a safe in the wall held in place by bolts. Some guy managed to unscrew the bolts by hand and remove the entire safe from the wall. His group did not accomplish actually opening the safe. 4) A group of boy scouts came in to play, having never done an escape or puzzle room before. The room they played had a time limit of 60 minutes. They finished it in 22. 5) Somebody walked into our storefront on St. Patty's Day asking if we were a dispensary. Hooray for Colorado. 6) Also on St. Patty's Day, somebody stole the chalkboard sign we posted out front with chalk art and the company logo. Like, just picked up the sign and ran off with it. We have also had our fair share of marriage proposals here, but they've all worked out so far. Nothing really worth repeating. ",

                    "body": "Hey, I'm finally relevant in a thread now! I manage an extremely popular room escape business in western Canada. I have a few stories: 1) One of our puzzles required wearing a pair of glasses to look at an LCD screen, while another player spins a dial to change what is shown on the screen. A grandma with what appeared to be her three grandchildren were playing it, and the grandma was getting very aggressive with the kids. The youngest kid ended up standing in the corner saying \"Well if you're not going to be nice then I'm not gonna play anymore.\" The grandma resolved this situation by smacking him upside the head a few times until he cried. It was awkward. 2) We had a group punch a hole through the wall, and drop a bunch of magnets that were needed for a puzzle into the crack in the wall. This happened two hours into a Saturday shift, meaning we had to take apart the whole wall when we only have five minutes between our rooms to fix this monstrosity, and we ended up breaking the bottom of the wall, reaching in with our hands and grabbing them, and then covering up the whole ordeal with a bookshelf. 3) The same group that put a hole in the wall came back and did another room, and they didn't understand anything that was happening. They refused assistance to further themselves along, and spent the last ten minutes of their time making out in the corner. We had to physically intervene when she propped herself up on a counter, and he started taking off his belt... We put that to an end real quick. They might rent the room by the hour but keep your damn clothes on. 4) The oddest one by far however, was a guy who called and was speaking to a female employee who we'll call... 'Female Employee'. Nice. When he called from what I was told, was that he had told her that she had a really pretty voice and wanted to know her name. She told him her name (no idea why, that's weird as fuck) and then he asked when she'd be working because he wanted to come meet her. He ended up booking and paying for a whole room ($210 CAD for a single person) and when he showed up he asked if it could just be him and her (the female employee) in the room. She got really uncomfortable and called me over to deal with him. When I asked him to tone down his behavior he got really defensive and told me that I was selfish for keeping her all to myself. What? I asked him to leave or else I'd be calling the police. When we left work at 1am that night, there were only our two cars parked out front with a running car at the end of the road (cul-de-sac with Mon-Fri businesses so there should be no other cars) and the car followed her when we left. I ended up following both of them while calling the police but the creepy guy fucked off down one of our busier roads and never heard from him again. 5) You cannot bring babies into the room. I don't know why you would want to bring a two week old baby into a room designed around horror and people jumping out at you, and if you try to bring your baby you will be denied entrance. I usually end up babysitting for an hour when this happens as long as the parents are nice. If you are rude, I have the power to make you not escape despite how smart you think you are. Your ability to escape is literally controlled by me, if I want you to escape with 5 seconds left I can, and if I want you to escape with twenty minutes left I can. Lots of people try to have sex. Key word try. We have to shut that shit down right away because A) it's disgusting and B) I feel like there's some legal shit that could go down if that came out. Also alcohol. When groups come in that have been consuming alcohol, we have to watch them super close because they try to do a lot of stupid shit when drunk. Why you'd mix puzzles and logical thinking with booze I'll never know, but you pay me so I don't really care. A couple common questions I'll answer: \"Haha can I get the video footage so I can show my family in seventeen years at a wedding?\" No, we do not give out video footage. Some places might do it like when you get a photo on a roller coaster, but if I were to give you the one hour long video footage of you in the room, you could pretty much do anything with it and post it online, ruining the experience for those who haven't been here before. We try really hard to keep our rooms as surprising as possible because we love to scare our customers. \"Why do I have to put my phone in a locker? I'm expecting a call.\" If you're expecting a call, then leave your phone with your game master. We will come and get you if your babysitter calls. We do NOT want you to have phones in the room for two main reasons, being that you could take photos and videos in the room and spoil it all, and that we also have fairly strong magnets and don't want to chance you rubbing up against it and somehow injuring your phone. (Our only exception is Selena Gomez, she got to keep her phone on her when she came in) \"It must be a lot of fun to watch customers all the time, and laugh at the stupid thing we do hahaha\" I always respond to this one with a smile and say something along the lines of \"Haha yeah, it's really fun to find the unique ways that people find the answer to puzzles!\" I hate watching you, unless you are a fun group that makes jokes. I have lots of stories working here, and can answer any questions if you guys have any. ",

We covered the majority of entrances/exits with large plywood sheets and trash bags. Filled the dimly lit tunnels with fake cob webs and roleplayers in zombie and various other monster masks. One guy noped out and fought his way through a wooden wall. Which sucks because I really want to do something like that again but am worried that someone else is gonna try to punch their way through the roleplayers instead :( We also had a group rip all the lighting out the walls thinking they where quest items. At the start of the dungeon crawl we briefed everyone not to mess with the props and only collect items which are tagged with index cards. They came out holding lightbulbs and strings of christmas lights.... WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! Like I totally understand if they grabbed some of the fake skulls or picked up one of the lanterns because you needed more light but at what point are you like lets rip these lightbulbs out of the walls they are probably worth XP. We have also had some younger players out scouring the woods and occasionally find a bong/pipe that they bring back but that I can understand. You found an oddly shaped glass object out in the woods while looking for fake gems and brought it back to camp. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af ",

We entered the room and the lights were turned off, then this guy starts declaring how much he needs to piss. This was one of the horror rooms, loosely based on the Saw movies, so there was an empty toilet with a key to open one of the padlocks for a puzzle inside. He literally pulls his pants down to his ankles and starts urinating in this standalone toilet. Everyone is looking in horror at what the fuck is happening in front of them. Piss is flowing from the bottom of the toilet onto the floor now. Everyone is backed up into a corner to avoid the ominous trickle of doom. Children are screaming. Somehow, the employees never noticed until we had made it out of the room and he was left behind sleeping on one of the mattresses cuddling with a bloodied dead body",

Even searching directly for \"aerolite *and* 1815\", the best source I can find is [this one](http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/category/?id=6735&page=1), which I believe only wants to say that the word \"aerolite\" (for a type of meteorite) was first used around 1815. I'm fairly certain you had exactly a [million-to-one chance.](https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Million-to-one_chance)",

It was a space themed one, and at one point, you open this uplink and get into a crawl space. In it, there are numbers spelled out in Russian, and you're supposed to solve another puzzle to get a computer screen to show you the words and their meaning. I was in the main room trying to figure out how to solve the final puzzle when I hear my friend shout \"Wait, is that Russian? Yeyande, get in here!\" we proceeded to skip a few steps in the room because I speak Russian. When we finished, the game master was so confused and had never thought that something like that would ever happen.",

They're usually idiots, they often sneak beer into our unlicensed establishment, they sometimes spill said beer on our props, and get unbelievably salty when they can't figure out a puzzle. One particular guy sat down and looked depressed/passed out the entire time while his friends sometimes poked/kicked him. He was a huge downer. Turns out he snuck in vodka in a coffee cup - I found out because he spilled some, his partner tried to clean it up and told me it was water. It was not water. One proposal we had, the fiancee-to-be was so interested in finishing the final puzzle that she didn't notice her boyfriend trying to lead her to the envelope he snuck into the last drawer. But when she finally saw the ring, it was super cute and sappy. ",

The other two... It's week 9 of 12 and I sent an email to the team advising two members that their contributions were consistently late, incomplete, very poor quality and thus unusable, and if things continued in this manner, I would not be able to put their names on the final submission. One student freaked. She interpreted my words as \"You haven't given me anything\". In the ensuing email-storm, the tutor said *\"OK, meeting with me after the next tutorial.\"* The situation was clarified at the meeting and it seems the tutor's private remarks have had some effect, which is good. The 2nd trouble-student however, has so poor English that he couldn't even follow the content of this disciplinary meeting and so just sat there, as he usually does, starting at the desk in front of him and making the occasional strange noise. At one point the tutor asked everyone to confirm a point. *\"Ben...\"* the tutor prompted. Silence. *\"BEN...\"* Huh? \\*something unintelligible* *\"I need you to confirm that you understand what we're doing from now.\"* Oh, OK then silence. *\"So... what are you doing from now?\"* \\*something unintelligbile\\* *\"What have we been talking about?\"* \\*something unintelligible\\* /me facepalms.

Okay, story time, I'll also include some observations about people in the room, it's quite fascinating. - Had somebody that tried to destroy the heating and cooling system. He got up on a chair and tried to rip it from the ceiling, I've never been in the room faster. - No matter how many times you say: \"The entrance is not the exit\". When people ultimately find the \"escape-key\" they all run to the entrance. - I had a woman who was screaming **at the top of her lungs** that my hints were making her group fail, she was the only one complaining. When I opened the door to get her group out she was super peaceful. It's like people turn into beasts when locked up, who would've thought. - Had a lady who in the beginning asked: \"Can I Snapchat inside the room?\" \"No you cannot\" \"But how do people know I'm okay?\". Yeah I didn't even knew how to respond, so I didn't. - Had people that: - Ripped the wallpaper off the wall. - Destroyed the floor because they think something is hidden. (We tell them there's nothing underneath it, which some people actually think is a hint) - There is a little \"hint-door\", we put hints behind it written on paper and I tell kids all the time: **\"THERE'S NOTHING BEHIND THAT DOOR\"**. But every damn time a kid walks up to it, starts opening and closing it before putting their hand inside. This one instance I was so done with it I *shook their hand* and let go, they freaked out and never touched that door again. - People think they can get out within 10 minutes, a lot of groups think this and then fail super hard at the most simple tasks. On the other hand, some groups are super chill and calm and solve it like nobody's business. - One of the most **bizarre things** is how we can fuck up relaying information, you give the hint \"4376\" and people manage to say: \"HEY WE GOT A CODE, IT'S 7364!!\". Not just with numbers, I've had people forgetting to say words in sentences and just completely screw the hint up. If more people are interested I'll tell some more, it's a beautiful thing. ",

But the trick is to realize that the game is meant to be fun, solvable, and not potentially lawsuit-inducing. Tangents are inevitable, because you're trying different avenues to find a solution, so the trick is to learn when to give it up. Your brain is incredibly good at finding patterns, so you have to decide which ones are likely to be there intentionally. My boss' theory was, if you haven't made progress on something in 3 minutes, set it aside. You'll have more luck if you imagine someone is trying to communicate with you (and knows you have a time limit) than if you imagine the room is out to trick you. A good game won't ask you to have any outside knowledge or skills and should provide everything you need to know inside the room. If you notice a pattern developing but can't put it all together yet, you may not have all the pieces, so set it aside and come back to it. They shouldn't ask you to do anything that might injure or kill you, or damage their property. Eventually you do develop an instinct for how strongly the room is pointing you in a certain direction, and learn how to switch focus to pick out clues. It's its own skill set that just has to do with learning the language of puzzles. ",

Obviously you can't really stop people who reach genuinely bizarre conclusions like the idea that a puzzle requires them to drink muddy water they got out of a jar they had to force off of a shelf, but it should be a hard and fast rule that guests shouldn't have to do anything destructive or risky to complete an escape.",

There is nothing involving the fire extinguisher that is a part of the game. Please do not touch the fire extinguisher unless there is a real actual fire.\" No joke.

It's like that. The hypnotist says I'm a chicken? I'm a chicken. Hypnotist says I'm looking at Adam Sandler? I'm looking at Adam Sandler. Your brain is kind of overloaded with stimulus so you just relax. I liked being hypnotized. I felt very loose and relaxed and I wish I could do it more often. Edit: Also, for the naysayers: there really is scientific evidence for it. Obviously, you have to do it right. The hypnotist can't stutter, no uhs and ums. The hypnotist has to be confident and tell you what to do. It's kind of like roleplaying in a BDSM thing. The dom is telling you what to do, not asking. I said in another comment it's like a psychological exploit of the brain. There's no swinging clock. There's no \"you're getting sleepy\". It's more like \"And we're relaxing, relaxing, relaxing, SLEEP!\" And then you go all loose and relaxed. You don't really \"sleep\". You're half asleep. Like if you just closed your eyes at work and wanted to take a catnap. But your body is all lose like you're fully asleep. I remember almost falling out of my chair. ",

She saw an arachniphobia hypnotherapy thing, we were both unsure if it would work but it was at a respected zoo and at this point her fear was great enough that she was willing to try anything She did the course and came out without a fear of spiders. She had been terrified since she was a small child so it's the weirdest thing. These days she can happily pick up her own bedroom spiders and put them out of the window. She isn't fearless but it's completely within the realms of normal.

I could hear every word, and felt safe due to a certain amount of lucidity. If he had asked me to take my clothes off, I would have been straight up awake and out of there. Instead it was very relaxing and calming. He had me imagine the safest place I ever felt (waking in my husbands arms and seeing the gold curtains lighting the room) and sort of connected it to my fear of blushing. So my mind was to link my safe place to my moment of panic. One thing that was really bizarre was that I only ever felt I'd been under for 10 mins when he gently awoke me and my hour was up! This happened over a few sessions but it did pretty much work! I would recommend it but only from practising professionals rather than anyone up on stage or in front of a crowd. ",

Just to get it out of the way, hypnosis is real and is classified as a state of consciousness by psychologists. There's a lot of hype and excessive spiritualism applied to it but in reality it's a state between wakefulness and sleeping. That's exactly what it feels like too, a sort of daydream where you're aware of what's going on but don't really care enough to think about it, like when you wake up and zone-out beneath the comfort of your covers. It's a sort of serenity where there's not much going on in your head so you can listen and focus on what the hypnotist is saying. I think one of my subjects said it best: \"it's like I'm there but I'm not\". While in that calm state of 'trance' the mind becomes susceptible to suggestions. This simply means the imagination becomes more potent and it's easier to agree than think about arguing. For example if at hypnotist started talking about tying a helium balloon to my wrist which started pulling up, then sure enough I would feel the string and let my arm lift. This works until you say something that breaches the subjects 'limits'. If I was told to raise my arm then I would do so without hesitation, if I was told to murder someone then that would hit my mental filter and I'd wake up instantly. It's also worth nothing changes are never permanent, they generally require reinforcement otherwise the suggestions fade, this can take anywhere between a week to a few minutes depending on your natural suggestibility and how much you choose to resist. But that isn't to suggest you can't start shenanigans, off the top I've my head I've had sessions involving: * Transformation into animals * Personality changes * Minor amnesia * Gender-swapping * Becoming the general of an army of cuteness created to obliterate all that is boring and 'adult' TL;DR hypnosis is real, wonderful and not a trick.",

I still felt like I had complete control if I wanted to break out of it, but it was so calming and relaxing that I didn't want to break out of it. You know that feeling when you've just woken up, but you haven't moved yet, and you know that when you do move, you'll have to actually get out of bed and start the day.

My teenage son was 'hypnotized' at one of those comedy-hypnosis shows at the county fair, and I can tell you with 100% certainty that **something** happened there. He volunteered to go up on stage, and made the cut to be included in the show. Throughout the next hour and a half (or so), the normal light-hearted shenanigans went on... 'when I touch my cheek, you'll see a huge spider on the stage, and freak out over it' kind of stuff. When the show was almost over, the hypnotist set all the participants up with one last 'suggestion' - after they'd returned to their seats in the audience, they would have some sort of reaction to one more word. While he was giving my son the instructions, the assistant came up behind my son, put a big blond wig on him, and stuffed 2 balloons down the front of his shirt (to go along with the instructions he was receiving). After all the participants had received their final instructions, they were all sent back to their seats in the crowd - we were all warned not to react any differently to our friends and family members. As he was running through the end of his patter, the assistant running the music put \"Barbie Girl\" by Aqua on the sound system. As soon as the song started playing, my son shoved his way to the center aisle, ran to the front, jumped up on the stage and took the microphone from the hypnotist, then started vamping around the stage singing the song, dancing like a fool in front of 200 or so people. I can tell you with 100% certainty that this is not something that my son would ever have done on his own. As any parent can tell you, there are certain things that you get to know and trust about your kids, and there are certain situations where you can say with 100% certainty how they will act; you sometimes know your kids better than they know themselves. You know their thought processes, you can predict with increasing accuracy how your child will behave when they encounter a situation, and you let them get to that point on their own (as part of the parenting process). I can tell you that having known my son for 13 years (at that point), there is absolutely no way he would have been willing to perform like that on his own. Period. There is no bribe he would take, no threat he would react to in that way. Absolutely none. No amount of threatening, bribing, or cajoling that I (let alone a stranger) could come up with would get him on stage singing Barbie Girl with balloons under his shirt, in front of even one person, let alone 200.",

I gradually started to remember what happened during it. My friends had to tell me about some things I couldn't remember. It was a really weird sensation. He made some of us believe we were on the Titantic when \"My Heart Will Go On\" was played. We ended screaming at others to get off the boat. When he switched the music, people would fight their shadow. There was a \"news report\" of the first men to give birth. 2 guys went into labour, a few of us acted as nurses and the rest were reporters. One of the fellas cried as he held \"his baby\" in his arms. The one I really struggled to remember was when he made me and another girl believe he was Johnny Depp and we were fighting to get close to him and desperately followed him around stage. He made the guys think he was Emma Watson. He did a few other bits but I can't properly remember them. It was a really strange feeling. Like I missed 2 hours of my life. ",

For all I know she hypnotised me and went to get coffee lol The whole idea about being hypnotised and being made to do stuff is a bit of a myth- most hypnotherapy sessions are more just where you go into a state of hypnosis and the hypnotist tries to reach your \"subconscious mind\"- asking it questions (as you lose consciousness you are usually unable to lie or think too much about what you want to say before saying it so the truth is more likely to come out) or talking to it",

It was many years ago, I'd been ill for a while and - honestly - I'd not recommend it for people like me with severe mental health concerns. I was certainly in some kind of still conscious and aware altered condition, which he described as a \"light\" trance. The hypnotist had put some kind of sensors on my finger tips, I'm not sure what the readout looked like. But when he started asking questions, if I balked at an answer he knew it and tried to persist on what he was asking. It felt like not answering would be difficult. He didn't unveil anything particularly shocking doing this. I suppose the point was to look for thoughts people suppressed. I already knew I was gay and had been out of the closet for years - he thought it was a \"breakthrough\" because I'd not mentioned it, although had not had cause to do so. One session, for reasons I cannot explain and am not consciously aware of, I resisted the trance state, he couldn't produce the effect he needed. Said it happens sometimes, can't explain why. And that was the end of it. Odd thing that still shows up - he tried to install a \"relaxation technique\" in the early sessions. Of tapping the tips of my thumb and middle finger together, do that and relax. I don't know it is relaxing, but I do still randomly do this from time to time. I notice it because I am very right hand dominant, and I do it with my left hand as he taught me. This was in 1997.",

I called around checking prices, and every where I called was just that, getting the price for the session. Until I called the last number. The guy on the end of the line was the actual owner , and he really was asking a lot of questions about my life and why I thought hypnosis would work for me. We talked for 30 mins. I decided to go with him because I really admired that. Like, thank you for taking the time. Fast forward to the day of the event. I was nervous but excited to go. Desperate, really. His office was tiny, composed of a reclining chair, a blanket, and his desk. He was tall, with curly dark hair , pasty skin and a thick accent (turns out he was from Serbia) Felt kinda weird but whatever, I'll give it a shot. He tells me to breathe in and out rapidly so I do what he says. I don't know exactly what it was but it was a very powerful session. It wasn't like I was hypnotized, it was something else. I've had a rough life from childhood and he made me delve deep in those corners of my mind. My body was almost vibrating, I started crying and then I hit this really nice spot in my mind. It went white is the best way I can describe it. I felt at peace, calm for the first time in a long time. The only thing that was annoying is when he was questioning me, he kept trying to get me to go further and further back. Like there was some heavy trauma in my toddler/early childhood years. I kept insisting that their wasn't, but he kept pressing. And that snapped me out if whatever trance I was in. He then tells me I'd have to do 2-3 more sessions at $200 each if I wanted to be free of my anxiety for good (a friend told me this would happen as he felt it was scam my from the jump) I told him I'd see how I felt and get back to him and I left. Whether it was real or not, I'm not 100% sure. But what I do know is at that time in my life, I would've paid any amount to get that sliver of serenity I had for those few minutes. I craved it. I was so tired and drained from battling panic attacks every fucking day. I held that feeling of peace for as long as I could. ",

I definitely wasn't just \"playing along\" - I sincerely was trying to talk. He brought me out of it a few minutes later, but it was one of the most surreal experiences of my life.

I remember it seemed both voluntary and involuntary at the same time. I wanted it to work but not everything did. I think I was in more of a trance than anything else, he got me to dance to a Michael Jackson song in front of everyone (which I would never do because in pretty shy and hate dancing) so I think my inhibitions were just worn down or something. I remember him saying that when he said a certain key word, that all of us under his spell woukd see a mouse run from under our chair. I didn't see anything but the girl next to me FREAKED OUT. I was pretty disappointed that it didn't \"work\" as much for me, but maybe that's a good thing? I was in some sort of trance though, because my friends were up there doing hilarious things and I wasn't laughing, when I definitely normally would have. I'd be interested in trying it again. tl;dr Was in more of a trance than actually hypnotized, didn't see a mouse when \"commanded\" to, but danced when I nornally wouldn't have and didn't laugh at funny things when I normally would have.

They go home, and some hours later the guy gets a phone call from the sister. And she's pissed. She couldn't smoke. She had all the cravings, she was have early withdrawal symptoms, all she wanted was to smoke, but she couldn't. She needed him to tell her she could.

I lay on the bed while she sat in an adjacent chair and started with the usual hypno mumbo jumbo, e.g., \"close your eyes, concentrate on your breathing, relax...\" etc etc. She asked me to imagine walking to a cliff side overlooking the sea. On this cliff side there was a singular chair where I was supposed to sit. As she slowly counted down from 10 I was supposed to make my way to the cliff side (with my eyes closed, relaxed, concentrated breathing). I only remember hearing her get up to 6, and the next thing I remember is her counting back up, and asking me to retreat from the chair and go back in the direction I came. So it's almost like I fell asleep. But there was definitely something going on since the first and last thing I remember was her counting and me drifting off and waking back up. As for what happened in between, I'm not really sure. ",

You go into a sort of trance like state, I began watching ASMR nightly a few months after to replicate that trancelike state. You become open to suggestion and okay with it. The hypnotist is sort of like the guy behind the steering wheel, and he gently guides you to do this or to do that. Never during that time could he have told me to take my clothes off or do something rash, as I still felt half-conscious during the process. He made sure to tell us to breathe in and out, deep breathes, I kept doing that and sort of hyperventilated for a majority of the session, further increasing my confused, dreamlike state. He would guide us through a rollercoaster ride and had the sound effects of one playing throughout the segment. It was a really unique experience, and I definitely wasn't pretending. I'm a rather shy person as well, and when he asked the question, \"What would you buy with $50,000\", a huge smirk came across my face and I yelled \"grass\" being the stoner that I was in front of the teachers and whole 12th grade class. If I wasn't self-aware I'm sure I would've said weed or pot. I think that putting the hypnotist on spot and not wanting him to fail also played a role in me being so susceptible to what he said. I didn't want to ruin it, so I played along with it a little bit as well. Towards the end I was in a full trance, and once it ended the sun was starting to rise and I had absolutely no concept of how much time passed. Could've been a half hour or 2 hours, I honestly couldn't tell. It's a unique feeling, although I felt commands telling you to do bizarre things sort of takes you out of it. If I had a one on one session, I think the hypnosis session would've been much more intense. There are several hypnotization induction videos on YouTube which work okay but can't really replicate the feeling of having someone in person talking to you. I'd say if you toss one of those videos on around midnight and watch the whole hour or two from start to finish you'll feel the same way I did about 1/2 way to 3/4 of the way through, that's if you don't fall asleep completely.

This wasn't a show on the main strip; it was at a run down hotel way off the strip, and was a little seedy. But hey, it was cheap, so we were totally willing to check it out. There were maybe 50 or so people there. The hypnotist dude (HD) clearly had some shills in the audience, which I expected. But he was also trying to hypnotize the audience as part of the act. I was watching, thinking \"Eh, OK. I can see how *MAYBE* this could work on someone, but not just a random audience member when the HD can't even concentrate on one person.\" That seemed (seems) silly. So the show went on, and my memory of the show gets... I don't know... *weirder* the more I remember. I have this memory that at the end of the show, there were strobe lights and some dude flapping his bare dick around in the air. Whatever. I felt strange leaving the show, but you know, strobe lights. Of course it felt weird. I mentioned later to my husband about the dude with his dick out, and he looked at me strange. Apparently that never happened. I didn't believe him at first, because I *very clearly remember* seeing this. I even remember what the dude looked like, where he was sitting before he went up on stage, etc. But it didn't happen. So now the fact that my memory is sort of warped and fuzzy about all the events at the end of the show, combined with my husband swearing on our children that the Dick Guy actually *did not happen*.... well I guess the dude managed to hypnotize someone. And it was me. ",

I was part of a group of volunteers who ended up onstage and it mostly didn't work on me, but there were some tricks he used that did work. For one, I noticed that he had a \"plant\" in our group. There was a \"volunteer\" he hypnotised that I had never seen on campus before, who was RIGHT into it - when the magician \"hypnotised\" this guy to act like a five-year old, the guy was just a little bit too good at it. So even though I was up on stage, and had assumed the act was legit, I soon had my suspicions. (In fact, by chance I bumped into the same guy out in town not long after and mentioned to him that he'd been onstage with me as part of a hypnosis act; when the guy replied, it was very soon clear that he was referring to the wrong campus, proving that he was a stooge for the magician and travelled with him from place to place. No matter.) When the hypnotist asked us all to jump up and start wildly \"orchestrating\" whenever a piece of music played, I was one of the few who remained seated, watching bemused as the other students jumped up and started orchestrating. There were a couple of other things that didn't work on me either, but there WAS a feeling that I should not spoil the act, that I should play along. So when I was asked an \"embarrassing secret\", I told him one, little things like that. What DID work was at the end of the act, when we were told to stare into the eyes of his \"hypno dog\" - we would feel tired, and we would lay down and fall asleep. Well, one by one we looked into the eyes of this gormless dog and the people in front of me one by one lay down on stage and closed their eyes. I thought it looked strange, and wished I hadn't gone up. Well, my turn came and the damndest thing happened - I wryly looked into the eyes of this dog, and my eyelids got heavy, I found myself yawning, looking at the pile of dozing students and thinking \"I think I'll join them\". So I found my eyes getting heavier, my body getting more sleepy, and I lay down in this mound with the rest of the volunteers. Obviously, that was a trick as well - yawns are infectious, and your eyes WILL shut if you make no conscious effort to keep them open, and humans ARE prone to joining huddled sleepers when they feel tired. So, it wasn't TOTALLY effective, and I wasn't totally hypnotised - if at all - and it WAS contrived, but the psychological tricks that are used must make it seem fascinating to the audience, and they DO have an effect on you.",

I have this whole thing on video...and I'm sorry, but no I won't share as I prefer to leave the shame of my youth left where it is. The other student was blown away, not realizing that he was being put on stage with someone who did at one time have at least a conversational grasp of Japanese. Once it was over I had the full memory of the experience, it wasn't like it is portrayed on TV where the person forgets as soon as he or she wakes up. The other student asked me if I spoke Japanese after the show and I told him the truth. We are still friends now almost 18 years later.

Anyways, I like being hypnotized. First thing to remember is stage hypnosis is almost never the real thing. Real hypnosis almost always takes a long time to get you to trance, especially if you've never been hypnotized before. I can't imagine how susceptible you'd need to be to actually drop for someone you didn't know in front of an audience, but that is a pretty high bar to clear, even for people who trance regularly. Second, I would suggest that most people already know what trance feels like. If you've ever lost track of time reading a book or playing a video game, while driving (don't trance while driving, pay attention, you're driving a multi-ton metal death machine, but I'm saying Highway Hypnosis is a documented phenomena). Some people call it \"the zone.\" It's not a state of sleep, it's a state of hyper focus, shutting everything else out. In trance, you should be relaxed and suggestible, your reasonableness-testing thought processes shouldn't be online (but that took me several years of practice and luck to even happen once, and I still can't do it consistently.) You won't do anything that you don't want to do, and since you almost never have that reasonableness-testing part of your brain turned off, especially to start out with, you'll be able to recognize when a hypnotist is doing something shady. This is also the reason a hypnotist has to be someone you trust, because trance is a lot about comfort and relaxation. You're just not going to be able to manage it with someone you're not comfortable with. One of the first things a *responsible* hypnotist will do with a newbie in their first trance is give them a Safety. A Safety reinforces that the subject's feelings are more important than any need to do what the hypnotist says and that if the subject feels upset or irritated or offend or any other negative emotion towards any suggestion or description, they can and will come out of trance with no ill effects. Safeties are important, not only to ensure that hypnotists don't disregard your feelings, but to make you comfortable enough to trance in the future as well. I actually left the hypnosis community several times for months and years at a time because of my fear of hypnosis being used in the context of abuse. The only reason I'm in it now and haven't bailed yet again is that I made my own Safety file.",

For me, it is a state of very deep relaxation, in which individual senses start to disappear (especially sight, it is very hard to keep your eyes open) and mind is much more likely to take things literally. As for my sessions with other people - the ability to react to suggestion varies a lot. First, if they trust you, they are able to go much deeper. Second, just as people vary in imagination or ability to fall asleep, they vary in their ability to \"go under\". It might be trainable to some degree, though.",

According to the theories of psychologist Ronald Stone and the biomedical engineering models of Itshak Bentov, hypnosis is basically a technique which permits acquisition of direct access to the sensory motor cortex and pleasure centers, and lower cerebral (emotional) portions (and associated pleasure centers) of the right side of the human brain following successful disengagement of the stimulus screening function of the left hemisphere of the brain. The left hemisphere of the brain is the self-cognitive, verbal and linear reasoning component of the mind. It fulfills the function of screening incoming stimuli by categorizing, assessing and assigning meaning prior to allowing passage to the right hemisphere of the mind. The right hemisphere, which functions as the noncritical, holistic, nonverbal and pattern-oriented component of the brain appears to accept what the left hemisphere passes to it without question. **Consequently, if the left hemisphere can be distracted either through boredom or through reduction to a soporific, semi-sleep state, external stimuli to include hypnotic suggestions are allowed to pass unchallenged into the right hemisphere where they are accepted and acted upon directly.** Source: https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf",

He said it's from anxieties, being uncomfortable with the idea of hypnosis, or how people perceive control. We also talked about lucid dreaming as a reason because some peoples attention never shuts off enough to accept the weird of hypnosis.

Which was kind of hard because at that point in the show I was supposed to be yelling something every time the hypnotist said a certain word. The one thing that really stood out to me was how my buddy truly seemed hypnotized. He was sitting right next to me throughout the show, and at one point we looked at each other and he had some mad man, googly-eyed killer face that I had never seen before. At the end of the show, the hypnotist made it clear that once we drank some water, we would remember everything that we did during the show. Well of course I drank some water and \"everything came back to me\". But my friend didn't drink water right away. He was so paranoid because everyone was telling him to drink water and he just kept saying things like \"no.. I'm not thirsty. I don't need to drink water.\" I leave the prom after party to go to an actual party at a friends house, when suddenly I'm getting a call from my hypnotized friend at 5 am. I answer the phone and all he says is, \"you motherfucker... I drank some water.\" ... and then he hung up. ",

This priest gave this long sermon and then everyone lined up to have him press his thumb on their forehead. The line was long and me and a friend were near the back. I was maybe 10 or 12 and he was my best friend, we were super alike. Same hobbies, interests, did everything together, hung out every day. For about 4 minutes in this line i watched people be touched on the forehead by this man and have to be caught as they fell over backwards essentially asleep like you described for about 10 to 20 seconds. I was in awe. What kind of power was this? For those 4 minutes i *knew* god was real and in that room. My best friend, being right in front of me was the next person to go. He collapsed like a bag of bricks and i watched as he laid there motionless and then get up looking like he weighed 1000 pounds. Then it was my turn and i felt this rush of anxiety. The priest touched my forehead and i went from this partially very apprehensive state of mind to... Confused. It had no effect on me. I kind of just stared at him like I had been lied to so my whole life (was raised Catholic, family isn't SUPER religious but I always went to Sunday school, etc). My faith was immediately shattered. I just stared at this guy and wondered 100 things at once. Was everyone that collapsed faking it? Did god not accept me? Was i too evil? (Was never a bad kid, never really got in trouble and when I did it was for silly, minor childish things). Was i not capable of accepting this healing gift from God? Was something wrong with me? I had to be reminded that my turn was over and it was time to get out of the way so the next person could go. I looked back as I was walking away and sure enough, the person behind me was just getting back up from being \"healed\". That moment was the moment I was no longer a true believer. I went along for my family's sake for a few more years, hard to tell your family you don't want to go to church at that age. But being an adult now, i don't participate in anything religious really. I'm not really \"atheist\" i just don't think about it. Maybe God is real, maybe not. But those 10 minutes or so changed my whole perception of religion. ",

He probably explored the \"why\" the stutter is more severe in certain circumstances, shaping his view on his own condition and, thus, changing the way he saw himself. You see, stutter cannot ever fully go away, as it is neurological in origin, with the motor centers and \"refinement\" centers in the cerebelum affected. However, it does get more severe depending on the psychological and social context. As such, if you remove the psychological and social component, what is left is a stutter that manifests itself in only the most extreme cases with high anxiety, where even a \"normal\" person is affected by disfluency.",

It can never make you do something you wouldn't do but it definitely makes you way more open to doing things that you might do while drinking. And it definitely does change your perceptions on things. I can hypnotize people in very basic ways like making your arm too heavy to lift up or making you feel very hot or cold. It's always fascinated me how far the brain can be pushed. EDIT: since people seem into this I'll explain a little about hypnosis for those who might not know. Hypnosis isn't the swinging watch you see in tv. It's about breaking up normal actions to disorient the subconscious and leave it more open to quick bursts of suggestion. Now we can gain maximum control by going through 30 minutes of talking and such and it's great, but you can also do it rather quickly with practice you just have to disrupt the subconscious. How? Well here's an example: Let's say I go to shake your hand with my right hand. Naturally your right hand goes to shake mine. But what if as you do that, I drop my right hand and grab your forearm with my left hand. Done. Subcocious interrupted. I've confused your brain in several ways: 1. I offered a handshake and then retracted it without reason. 2. I used the wrong hand to grab you which doesn't make sense 3. I grabbed your forearm rather than your hand. In this 2-3 second period your brain is trying to figure out what just happened and your subconscious is distracted and open. So I can begin immediately telling you things such as you are feeling relaxed, peaceful. Let the stress wash away and feel only the peacefulness of rest and concentrate only on my voice. ",

The dude hypnotizing us said he would start cutting people from the stage as he determined the hypnotism started to wear off. Out of 15 of us, I was the last fucking person on the stage. I remember clucking like a fucking chicken, and dancing, fucking dancing! I'd never do this shit in front of the student body if I wasn't hypnotized. To be fair the other students didn't mock me, they laughed and cheered, and afterwards were giving me high fives and pat's on the back. The next day all my buddies were taking the piss out of me, but I kept trying to convince them I wasn't hypnotized. I think this is, or was the total mind fuck.

Then to demonstrate his point he told her to take all her clothes off... which she immediately started doing. Professor very quickly tells her to stop/snaps her out of it and apologises to her and the class.

The goal in many inductions is to get the brain thinking fast enough to sort of confuse it. I use a method where I hold my right hand out and the person holds their left hand out. We put our palms against each other and I apply light pressure. I ask the person to apply light pressure back, equaling my pressure so our hands don't move. Then I ask the person to imagine walking down a hallway, where there are doors on the left and right and you can't see the end of the hall. Each door has different random numbers on it. Then I start talking faster, reminding the person to maintain pressure on my hand, every 5-10 seconds or so, and to keep imaging the hallway and starting to jog, then run, then sprint, talking faster the whole time. Then I tell the person that they see the door at the end, and they BURST! through the door, and I slide my hand out of the way so that the pressure they are maintaining on my hand throws their hand forward. I don't understand the science as to why this works, but right after a loud \"BURST!\" and their hand flying forward, I ask them to listen only to my voice and then I talk their chin down to their chest with counting. This has worked really well for me, and after a couple times doing it with the same person, I don't even need to physically have my hand on theirs, they can imagine it well enough so when I yell BURST they fall forward as though I had moved my hand. I hope this helps give an idea of what an induction might be like.",

It was with a group of other people so not as expensive as a one on one session would be. Once you learn the techniques, you can actually just do it on your own and bring what you want to do into it. I would travel a lot for my job and would often use the boring time on the plane to hypnotize myself. I ended up losing at least 80 pounds.",

If your situation is that you tend to want to passively be 'done-to' and want someone else to 'fix' your behaviours, then a behavioural/cognitive behaviour therapy, motivational interviewing, perhaps something like solution-focused therapy could work in conjunction with hypnosis, and be more likely to work for you in the longer term than hypnosis on its own.

                    "body": "I've done quite a bit of research into this area due to my stutter, and you generally characterise it well. However, I don't think the psychological aspect is the whole picture. It's very important, but in my experience it's different for different people. I tend to see a lot of stutterers also have some form of social anxiety. This is unproven as far as I know, but I'm of the opinion that the social anxiety is a different issue that forms separately from the speech issues. However, once formed, social anxiety obviously would make the stutter worse. While it's easy to see why stutterers might be more prone to social anxiety, not all of them are like that. In general, I don't think I have social anxiety. Sure, I'll get a little anxious for a speech or something, but my fluency isn't noticeably worse in these scenarios. My stutter is honestly pretty static no matter what the situation is. The only reliably controllable variable I have is the amount of sleep I get, and whether or not I practice speaking out loud. All of this to say, while the psychological aspect of stuttering is very important, I still see it principally as a physical manifestation of neurons misfiring when activating the speech muscles. Simply put, talking is a really complex thing that most people just do without thinking about it. You have to control your diaphragm, lungs, vocal folds, tongue, teeth, and lips all in a really precise way just to make one sound, and nearly everyone on earth just effortlessly strings together this process 100s of times in one conversation. For whatever reason, a stutterer's brain just isn't wired exactly right for this. I've read some recent research that said it might be because of an excess of white matter in the speech areas of the brain, which would make sense. ",

When I was 20 I went to a Virginia medical school program that treats stuttering as something that can be unlearned; they teach you to speak again. I haven't stuttered for the last 21 years. I'm happy for those who are able to speak fluently after psychological treatment, but for your future patients sakes, keep in mind it may not be the solution for everyone.",

The mind is powerful and through determination anything can happen. But you have to want it. Even if your conscious is deciding not to there are probably parts you don't realize want to change. Start with free self hypnosis tracks on you tube, etc. Find someone you're comfortable with, reputable, and talking in a way that didn't reinforce negativity in thinking. For example I wouldn't use a track that says \"I never think about getting angry\" I would use one that says \"I look for ways to be peaceful and calm\" or \"when anger arises I can release it appropriately and quickly find inner peace\" etc. After using self hypnosis sessions it'll be easier to know if paying money to a professional will be helpful or it might even have helped enough to not need a pro. I personally used Wendi Friesen from Wendi.com for over a decade now. I've purchased almost all her sessions (she did a membership program at one point that was very cost effective) and loved her personal attitude and her employee's/business attitude and morals, etc. Hope that helps! Edit: remember, nothing- NOTHING is a cure all. You still have to put conscious thought, work ethic and choose to push yourself to your limits to be above average or beyond, but meditation is known by science to be effective for many aspects of healthy lifestyle. Hypnosis is a form of meditation and will definitely, if done right, help you overcome blocks you have mentally to a certain aspect our situation of life. Good luck!",

So you start by focusing on your whole body, imagine it as a human-shaped sponge filled with white light. Now focus on your feet, and imagine the light from your feet flowing up to your ankles, then to your knees, your hips, then into your torso. Do the same with your hands, move the light to the elbows, then shoulders, then your chest. Imagine all your light is concentrated in your torso, now move it up into your skull. Try to concentrate the light into a tight ball right in the center of your brain. Compress the light as much as possible. Now let the light grow again, filling your skull, washing over your face. Now move it down through your throat and into your upper chest. Feel your heart and lungs bursting with light. Move it down to your stomach. Now let the light radiate throughout your stomach, chest, and head. Feel it moving down your upper arms and legs, down to your fingers and toes. Imagine you are now completely radiating with light. When you feel ready, allow the energy decrease until you are completely relaxed. Imagine gently glowing like an ember. I like this technique because it gives my mind an activity while also totally relaxing me. I often do this after a yoga session. ",

You ever get that hyper focus on a repetitive action where your hands take over and your mind is elsewhere? It's basically getting your mind to take it and run with something instead I prefer a slowly rising tide on a warm day, making its way up my body, starting from my toes, inching up my feet, and so on. Just placing myself in it in my head. As I breathe in, it inches further, and goes out a little when breathe out. Eventually my head just kinda keeps with it without me trying, and at some point... I'm just gone. For someone like me, who gets dangerously bored so damn easy, it's kind of incredible.",

I discovered and got into an app called Headspace. It's a bunch of guided meditation stuff that I've found to strike the perfect balance between quiet enough that I can actually meditate and verbose enough I don't drift. It's definitely not how our brains are used to working so it takes time, but it's come easier and easier over time. I try to get 15-20 minutes in daily, same time every morning right after I take meds. I try to think of it as similar to lucid dreaming: too much effort or awareness and you'll wake up (or focus on not focusing, never works). Good luck! If you want more ideas on ADHD meditation I'm happy to share more that's worked!",

Do that for 15 mins-45mins a day every day, then much like any muscle exercise, it gets easier and easier. Eventually, your brain is so trained, you can shut down for longer periods of time.

You don't need to find new things each time, so it's fine to repeat yourself. * Repeat, making two statements about what you see, hear and feel. * Repeat, making one statement about what you can see, hear and feel. * At some point during this process, your eyes will probably want to close, which is fine. Simply make statements about things you can see in your mind's eye. * If appropriate, spend some time reliving a time and a place where you've felt perfectly relaxed, or imagine yourself at a forthcoming event acting in exactly the right way. * Return to the room when you are ready. http://www.abouthypnosis.com/self-hypnosis.html ",

Focus on a scenario, like a secret moon base was discovered and you're a member of the team that has to go check it out. You'll be thinking \"How many of us are on this team? What would be logical? How would we gain access? Do we just blast through the doors? Is this base actually a secret government base or otherwise built by or for humans?\" Usually by this time I'm asleep, and occasionally I'll dream about the scenario in some respects. I stay with one single scenario night after night until I have a vivid dream about it, then it kinda loses its allure and I move on to something else. I've been doing this for at least 30 years, pretty much every single night. But I sleep pretty well, so there you go.",

I've seen the sort of thing I think you're describing on TV - large American churches full of people lining up to get the devil slapped out of them (or something to that effect) by a charismatic preist, but never heard anyone call it out as hypnotism before. It totally makes sense that that's what they're actually doing. I've read that hypnotism relies on the person being hypnotized to, on some level, be complicit in or want to go along with what's happening. In your case, I'm assuming there were lots of people around? Or other people were doing the same thing? Maybe your subconscious was making your body follow or give in to social cues/pressure? It fascinates me for some reason, I'd really like an expert's explanation of what is happening here.",

People who stutter aren't more shy, they are just fearful for their own participation because they keep thinking on how they will stutter or precisely what will they say, wich only makes it worse. In your case, it seems you have mostly surpassed all the areas that could affect you. Of course, the biologic issue cannot be controlled, but in your case you were able to get it under some degree of control, wich is excelent. About the neurologic part, we don't know exactly what causes it. TAC scans reveal a chain bileteral overactivation of most areas related to speech, I believe only the pre-motor area is left relativity unaffected. I'll leave a link to a couple of very interesting research. It's amazing just how complex a simple sentence is, isn't it? From forming the thought, to connecting it to a concept, to attaching it to a word, to arranging a wide set of motor instructions to produce the sequence of sounds while, at the same time, receiving feedback from your own output so that you can rearrange your pitch, volume or even content of the message. And we do it all without even blinking an eye :) [Link 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4233907/) [Link 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2492392/)",

As for your treatment, I am trully glad it worked out for you :) I don't have the data but I would assume they worked the mechanics of speech with you, teaching articulation and breathing to go around your problem. This isn't new, but it probably was something groundbreaking 21 years ago. Currently, what we do is firstly to adress the way the person sees himself. As in, try to make the person understand what he has and come to terms with the fact he has a problem that is not his fault. This is very important before we can start adressing the mechanics, because if we teach only the mechanics (as I know in some cases) there is a chance the person might, at some point, stutter without expecting it. Can you imagine that? Believing your problem is fixed, you \"freed from the curse\" and then suddently all coming back again? We risk a severe aggravation of the original problem. Hence, why we currently do it in stages: First, the person. Then, the stutter. In your specific case, have all the episodes of disfluency been erraticated? Do you still struggle sometimes when facing high anxiety? ",

They aren't relaxed, maybe their neck isn't fully resting on their chest, maybe they have tensed leg muscles, etc. When you are induced you are really relaxed and you sort of go limp, you certainly don't have tense muscles. They don't respond the same way as everyone else does when you do certain commands. Most people after they are induced respond the same way to certain things I try. The most common things I do are \"imagine your hand is the so heavy that you could never pick it up no matter how hard you try\" and they won't be able to pick up the hand. But someone faking won't actually be trying as hard. When you ask someone that's induced to pick up their hand, you can see their whole arm except their hand try to pull the hand away. When you tell someone they are naked in an igloo, almost everyone gets goosebumps and actually starts to shiver, this doesn't happen with someone faking it. There are a lot of tells that you learn as you do it a lot. I also didn't mention in the first post, I've been induced a few times by my Aunt who taught me, so I do know it's a legit thing. Most of the tops posts here are accurate. Things you imagine while induced, the brain thinks are real and responds to them as if they were real, to a limit of course.",

I don't think there's anything that could \"go wrong\" so I think it's harmless to give it a shot. That's really the only way to learn other than taking a class.

Perhaps it will remind you of a fond memory you have of being perfectly content. Maybe you would like to go to that moment and let the feeling you had once again wash over you perhaps the tension will just melt away starting at the tips of your toes and slowly going up your body. With every breath, you may find yourself closer and closer to that state of perfect relaxation. ",

Maybe your subconscious was making your body follow or give in to social cues/pressure? Very much so. I'd been dragged along to the meeting without knowing what it was about, and my only transport home was with the people who'd bought me, so staging a scene or walking out wasn't an option. People had been \"slain in the spirit\" all around me so there was a lot of psychological pressure to conform. I don't know if it's exactly hypnotism in the case of Benny Hinn style shenanigans where the preacher just points and people fall over in waves - I think those people are fully indoctrinated and are ready to collapse at the flick of a finger. What was happening at this meeting was much more personal. The preacher walked up to people, pressed one hand on their forehead, waving his other hand up and down around their face and body while staring into their eyes and praying in a low but firm voice with a steady rhythm. All of which is classical hypnotic technique. As I said, I don't think the preacher was a con man in the sense that he was being deceptive. I think he honestly believed he had been taught to \"call down the spirit\", and the person who taught him probably believed it and so on back to someone who *was* a con man, or who honestly stumbled onto the technique without realising what it was.",

What I mean is even in a high stress state such as speaking to a group, when I do stutter it's the only occurrence for the duration of the speech. You're also right about the techniques.

He was up acting like he was fighting with a lightsaber, and I was talking him through the fight in the same voice as my hypnosis, but that's the one experience I still don't know if was real or not.

Since maturing and becoming more self conscious, I started bundling up outside and I expect to be cold and now my tolerance is harder to maintain. There is definitely a tolerance that is completely dependant on your thoughts though. Bit of a random analogy, but lately I've been taking lessons about life from my dog. When its cold out, or hot out, he just keeps on trucking like nothing is changed. He still has his goals, he never let's anything hold him back and I find that to be so motivational. He has given me so many more examples, like constantly smashing his face against shit. Just shake your head and move on, it's such a human trait to dwell on shit that can't be changed.

When I hit the third stage of sleeping, more lightly again, I wake up instantly and have to get on my feet or my head becomes utter chaos. The upside is that around 4 hours of sleep per night is more than enough for me. Sort of relevant, I'm 30+ and have had this sleep schedule for as long as I can remember with the youngest of years me having a ton of sleep issues, which were resolved by the meditation method I described in my earlier post when I was around 16.

I immediately go through the platitudes--\"I'm so sorry this happened, sir, we'll get it taken care of right away, etc. etc.\"-- while i'm checking out the phone. As he's ranting, I plug it in with one of our charging cables, and it lights up. Everything's working fine. I try again; still good. \"Oh, sir, good news!\" I tell him when he's stopped to take a breath. \"It looks like it might just be a problem with the cable--why don't we get it replaced for you and we'll see how everything's doing?\" He stops, glares at me, and goes (in a very thick Texas drawl) \"you mean to tell me you have to plug. it. in?\" Long story short, I giggle because I think he's joking, he's not joking, he storms out (with his working phone) yelling something like \"what's even the point of a WIRELESS phone??\" ~~And then there's the guy who tried to clean some dirt off his brand new computer by dunking it in soapy water.

Not sure what infuriates me the most but: - Why the hell previous employee left without saying he had a broken pc and how did he \"work\" his last month there. - Why on earth the new employee that took his spot has said nothing for more than 2 weeks. But to top all of that the insanely hard way to save that pc from becoming a pile of trash, was to turn on the freaking switch on the back of the tower from 0 to 1. FOR 2 FUCKING MONTHS. ( also a similar case were just the power cable was disconnected while they cleaned the room ). *bonus case* ( not mine but a friend also in IT at the time): She was asked to check a computer that was not working properly. She tries to move the tower to bring it outside of beneath the desk, and the it is extremely heavy and makes a lot of noise. She opens the tower to see what the hell is going on and a surge of coins starts dropping out. The tower was full on coins because the children of the family thought that when he lost in a game he had to insert more coins through the floppy disk drive.",

She gets the emailed documents, prints them, organizes them in stacks on her desk, then walks over to the scanner and re-scans them in one at a time to a folder, where she renames them and uploads them to the logbook. I tried to get her to just save the document to the rename folder and rename it there, but she claims the other way is faster and \"helps her organize\" better. She also sorts her email by person in outlook and minimizes all of them, then waits for the person's name to be bold to see if she has an email from them. Once she opens an email she refuses to do anything until that email is resolved because she will \"lose the email\". I tried to show her folders, but she just gets really angry and starts saying \"no\" over and over. Edit: forgot an apostrophe",

I was on your website, and I think your computers are on fire.\" Me: \"I'm sorry? What do you mean? We have a lot of computers here and nothing is on fire.\" (We would get a rare prank call here and there.) W: \"I was buying something on your website, and my computer started smoking. I just wanted you to know so you could put it out.\" Me: (Confused, until it dawned on me that when she went to the Best Buy website, it connected to the local Best Buy, and that our servers were on fire *and traveled through the phone line* to catch hers on fire). \"Miss, is there still smoke coming out of your computer?\" W: \"Yes, it's getting worse.\" Me: \"You need to hang up now, and call the fire department. Unplug it if you safely can, but call 911 immediately.\" W: \"Oh, okay. Thank you!\" That was the end of it.

But now her process is inexplicably to compose an email in the isp-provided account and then COPY/PASTE it into gmail to send it. For the life of me, I can't figure out how she came up with this system.

She calls me in, totally convinced that \"the computer must have been hacked\". Me and my sister convince her we've got it all in hand, and show her how to get to the website. She calls us back in not 2 minutes later, because she's now confused as to why she can't access her emails- which was of course because she's not logged in. Tried to tell her to log in, but she's convinced that she's \"never had to do that\" and \"I don't know of any password\". Eventually she got frustrated and I heard from my Mum that she went to try and use the library computers the next day. Got the same results and stomped all passive-aggressively out, came back in a sulk. I just couldn't get how she thought that if she accessed any computer, *anywhere*, it would give her access to her emails. What did she think happened when other people used those computers? That they could just go though her email? Or alternatively, how did she think the computer was able to tell it was her? Would the mouse scan her fingerprints, or maybe there's a hidden camera somewhere that scans her face against a huge database and logs her in when there's a match?

When the CEO asked how he had messed up the values so badly, the guy shrugged and said he had not written the PowerPoint, his intern had. When they were asked why the guy had not done it himself or at least fixed the values he said \"I don't know or care to know how to run PowerPoint, that's not my job.\". The CEO put in a mandatory computer literacy test for a few months later. Failure to pass meant a mandatory training course followed by a retest. Failure to pass again resulted in termination. According to my boss, more than one Fellow and at least one department manager either quit, rather than be forced to learn basic computer tasks, or else failed twice.",

Everyone here in the office either grew up with email or have been exposed to it for 10+ years as an everyday part of their fucking job. Yes, you need to be judged for not knowing how to forward, attach documents, not reply all, etc. Its not because I'm a 'millenial,' you retard. Youve been using outlook for 23 years and still look confused when i tell you to click on the paperclip to attach your word document with your screen shots? Sorry, you're clearly not capable or interested in learning fundamental requirements of your job (over **decades** at this point) and should be canned. Its inexcusable. You only email for work? Fine. I only use the fucking pallet wrapper at work and i still managed to figure out all the buttons and switches to that. ",

                    "body": "You know the sad thing about this is not that I completely believe you but that I have seen this sort of thing many, many times before and even managed to understand how such things happen. I used to have trouble wrapping my head around this sort of behavior, but you can only so often gather everyone in your office around your monitor to point in disbelief at an attachment to a ticket that is a work document named screenshot and has an image pasted into it that clearly at some point went though a fax-machine. It stops being noteworthy after a while and you just get used to it, like you get used to not emptying recycle bins because you just know that this is where the user stores all their important documents. What I figure about the print it out and scan it back in workflow is this: Users don't understand what they are doing. They memorize some steps they have to do to achieve a certain result. They have no idea what every single one of those steps do. As far as I can tell they are functional black boxes and magic spells to them. You perform a ritual and get results. Sometimes you don't get the results and call a shaman who is knowledgeable about the deeper mysteries of these things, but to you as a user you only need to know how to perform the ritual. This might seem strange but I think it may likened to someone memorizing a phrase from a phrasebook for a language they don't speak. They learn that phrase but they have no idea what the words in the sentence they have memorized do. A fluent speaker will be able to say that phrase and be able to modify it to better suit the relevant occasion. \"The might say \"good evening\" and \"good morning\" rather than \"good day\" at the appropriate point without even thinking about it. A non-speaker couldn't do that they don't no which part of the sentence they are uttering is responsible for which part of the idea they are trying to get across. They can't modify it. This naturally makes computer illiterate people inflexible. If you make slight changes the computer that a computer literate person would not even notice they will be totally lost. This means that users who \"aren't good with computers\" need to be carefully guided when something changes. It may make them look stupid to your eyes. This is not necessarily true. Thinking they are just stupid leads you to the same trap as idiots who assume that foreigners who have trouble with their language are stupid. Granted some users are stupid and smart user may even learn the language of computers well enough to understand what they are doing, but not all computer illiterate people are stupid. Some are quite clever and come up with clever solutions to their problems given their limited resources. They want to send the contents of an document somewhere per email. They don't know how to do it, because nobody has ever shown them the right spell for the occasion. They do know a ritual that turns electronic documents into printed paper documents. They also know a second ritual that turns printed documents in pdfs that you receive in your notes or outlook program. They also have a third spell that allows them to forward emails. Coming up with the idea of combining and chaining these three arcane rituals purely on the input and output of each without understanding what each does, takes certain kind of retarded genius. It is not a workflow that anyone who understood what they are doing would have chosen but it is one that works for them, at least until somebody shows them a better way. Just be careful not to insult them when you teach them the new magic spell and keep in mind that most non-wizards can only memorize a very limited number of spells per level, unlike proper mages who can simply derive the correct ritual for the occasion on the sport from primary principles. Not everyone understands magic like you do and somewhere there might even be somebody with a far deeper understanding of the arcane arts than you and he is probably pointing and laughing at the overly complicated methods you sometimes use to achieve your goal when there are far simpler and more elegant ways that only require that you have a better understanding of what you are doing.",

I was astounded that there were people who could not pass the test. I was even more astounded when I ended up working with people who passed the test who still couldn't complete basic tasks using such simple skills. So, yeah, it's definitely a thing. I ended up in IT via tech support, and my ultimate goal was to work myself into a position where my daily life wasn't r/talesfromtechsupport.

During my last weeks, the executive who had protected the maniac for decades was laid off, and the troops mobilized and got her fired.

But this is incorrect because nowadays most kindergartners don't know how to use a mouse because they are used to touch screens. They still need to be taught the basics (cut, copy, paste, how to align text.) And for the love of everything that's holy, it is not called left justified, right justified and center justified. It's called aligned/alignment! Justified is the text alignment where the text is even on both margins. Somehow at my school the word \"justified\" became the word for aligned and it drives me nuts.",

She grew up with outhouses and wood burning stoves for cooking, etc. They used to gather around for radio serials, and she could remember the first black and white tv bought in her community. They used to cross the river by wading through the snow that was on top of the ice, to get to the house that had a tv just to see it. When she would try to record something with the vcr she wouldn't check to see if the tape was rewound. Of course the tape would shut off part way through and somehow it would be my fault. Every time. She also never took a decent picture - heads cut off, finger in front of the flash, etc. But we couldn't use the camera instead because \"it's expensive! You'll break it\" sure mom. Even once she got a digital camera, she couldn't grasp that what she sees is what she gets. Once she got a laptop she took paid lessons on how to use google and email but it didn't help. It was \"broken\" all the time. She made the most delicious sweets from scratch on a pauper's budget when we were kids though. Drilled my spelling and multiplication tables. No one is good at everything and I think technology was just too steep of a learning curve. ",

Control + arrow keys will move the cursor across entire words.* Shift + arrow keys will select characters. Control + Shift + arrow keys will select entire words.

(Chrome, Firefox probably) Control + T opens a new tab Control + W closes tab or window EDIT: How could I forget Control + Backspace for deleting the whole word. Thanks /u/ImottaWombat Here's a few more Windows + X opens the Windows 'poweruser' menu Windows + 1-9 number row opens the corresponding program on your task bar, starting after the Task View switcher.

In other words, it went from looking like a Y to looking like ll. He said he got surgery, but it was to cut a ligament, not separate into two penises. Also, he went from average looking to buff, if you look on his Twitter. The other thing is that they are large, it think he said like 10.5 inches, penises that big exist, though rare, and of course if someone fakes their penis that are going to make it huge. ",

She basically talked about continually dosing until she felt like a walking corpse and talked about how the experience made her feel completely connected to the world and allowed her art and drawing to flourish.

She also runs stats on dating sites and provides some analysis with her opinions and lives in a literal camgirl mansion in Vegas. Smoking hot pictures aside she seems like she would be a really cool person to just hang out with for an evening. And I don't mean that in any \"gonna make a move\" sort of way.

His parents would constantly try to avert the subject of his extra dexterous as much as possible. Heck, we might not ever have had the AMA because he would be so self-conscious about his *dos* ding dongs that he'd basically hide it from everyone besides his immediate family. Oh my god, imagine if he got married, the first time he and his wife consummate their marriage, he pulls down his drawers and exposes his 2nd and 3rd head to his equally Christian virgin wife. He is so embarrassed that he just lies to his wife and says that all men have a spare noodle between their legs, one nut for each chubby, even steven. His wife, none the wiser, ends up believing him. They have under the covers missionary sex with the lights turned off every night, maybe he'll even switch cocks if they're feeling especially adventurous. ",

If the penises grew 1.5 inches because the base moved outward, the penises would still be connected at the same point. In other words, the penises used to be connected let's say about 6 inches from the tip. Now, in the photos, the penises are not connected for 10.5 inches. The surgery only addressed the issue at the top of the penis, but did nothing to separate the connection at the base. ",

That isn't actually John Harvard. All depictions of Harvard were lost in a fire, so when they went to make the statue, they literally just pulled the most \"Harvard\" looking man off the street and sculpted away. Also, there's a common myth that rubbing his left boot will bring hopeful applicants good luck and a fancy acceptance letter.

In reality he was a ruthless, bloodthirsty conqueror who landed in North America by mistake and proceeded to commit (well-documented) acts of savagery against the native inhabitants, with the sole purpose of taking by force anything valuable that he could get his hands on. He is a glorified looter. I recommend that anyone surprised by what I'm saying reads \"The Rediscovery of North America\" by Barry Lopez. Fuck Columbus and his stupid holiday. He didn't discover shit, and should not be celebrated.",

The reasons for this range from \"there's so many other people voting that mine won't make an impact\" to \"government officials rig the elections\". Your vote actually does matter in any election that isn't presidential. Turnout is fucking abysmal in years that don't contain presidential elections, and if you're voting for say, a member of the state legislature, combine this turnout with the small portion of the state that *actually votes* for that particular seat, and suddenly your vote matters a lot. It is also the \"Your vote doesn't matter\" mentality that ruins presidential elections. Cynical registered voters will often avoid voting because \"it doesn't make a difference\" and as a result, they wind up with the candidate they hated the most, and also forgot to vote for a senator or congressman, and they don't even regret it. I think we need a system similar to Australia, where they actually fine people who don't vote. This will raise turnout by a significant degree, in all levels of government. We can make election day a holiday to make voting easier.",

She's not smug by virtue of being married, it's because every time she sees me she tilts her head to the side and asks how I'm doing, and whether I've found a decent guy yet, as though that's the be-all-and-end-all of life. She'll then launch into relationship or dating advice as if she has the first idea what she's talking about. She argues with her husband a lot, cries and throws tantrums, they throw objects at each other. They're both in a battle to get their own way a lot of the time, which she tends to win. She has concluded that shouting her husband into submission means that she's great at relationships. It took a lot for me to dump my fianc\u00e9 who was shit for me, and it takes a lot for me to end things with guys I've been dating briefly when it's clear that they'd be shitty in a serious relationship. My natural thing is to forgive, listen, understand, give another chance. I don't end things because it's some easy option, or because I'm 'bad at' relationships. I do it because it seems way more terrible to me to marry someone, or be with someone for decades, who I'm not happy being with. I hate that meme with the bullshit fake nostalgia harking back to the 'good old days' when \"if something was broken, we didn't throw it away, we fixed it\" with a picture of old Bert and Margaret sitting on a bench by the sea. I translate that shit into \"if the relationship was shitty, one person, probably Margaret, would just smile and take it and try to hide how awful it was so nobody else would know, after decades of it she's used to the way he treats her and puts up with it, pretending it's all a joke, resigning herself to that life, because she believes that that's just what men are like\".",

I would stay with someone I no longer loved for months until the emotional problems they caused me were worse than my fear of being hated by them, or being alone. I stayed with a guy who emotionally abused me (so badly I told my *mom* that I would \"probably deserve it\" if he ever beat me) for over a year when I was 14. I stayed with the guy who was the first person I had sex with (with my consent being iffy, even from what he should've seen) for four months after that experience. My relationships aren't long because I loved them, or because I was happy with them- often, I was miserable and felt disgusting and disgusted. But I was convinced that if I broke their hearts that I would be hated, and that being alone was scarier than having to have sex (or sexual activities other than penetration, for earlier boyfriends) that was painful and depression-inducing. Longevity definitely does NOT mean helathy or successful. Sometimes, it can mean exactly the opposite.",

But if wine enthusiasts can't tell the difference between value wine and expensive wine in blind taste tests, then I call bullshit. There isn't a go to source for robust data on this that I know of, but anecdotes that do exist suggest this is generally the case. I'm awaiting good tasting, mass produced wine in a different, more efficient form factor. Like a 12L box, potentially with simplified a nitrogen/ CO2 system to slow oxidation. That said, there are **LOADS** of decent-great table wines in the $5-$20 range, which is basically the cost of a large water at an airport on a ml/ml basis. I suppose commercial vendors would benefit most from a more efficient delivery system. And I like corks and all, but caps are actually better for the wine. Go Oz. ",

The 2 biggest factors for this are vanity sizing and dress sizes being based on bust size. In the 40s and 50s, dress sizes weren't determined by overall sizes. They primary factor was busy size. As Monroe had a larger than average bust, she needed a larger dress. She wore size 8 pants. At the time, size 8 was the smallest available. Over time, manufacturers realized that if people thought they were smaller, they would buy more clothes. That's vanity sizing, and it has dramatically changed the sizing system over the last 60 years. In today's sizing, Monroe would wear a size 4 or 6.",

If you were an adult, you got married and got the fuck of of your parents' house. 18-20-year-olds aren't really known for their great decision making skills in the first place, add to that the pressure to quick get married during that time period when you haven't had much time to even get to know the person. People settle for the first person they can stand, people change and grow away from others, and you just didn't get divorced just because. My own grandmother married my grandfather when she was 19 or so, not long after her parents were killed. I honestly think she chose him because he was the most 'solid' option and she felt like she needed a husband. (Women didn't really have the option to have a successful career and the like by themselves back then) She ended up having an affair when her kids were grown, and I understand how betrayed my mom and her siblings felt, but when I think of how my grandma must have felt? I think she felt trapped and her partner was the person who really made her happy. I have sympathy for her and I'm glad that she at least found her soulmate, even after what she did.",

For example I have this kid who struggles to understand a short story but is brilliant when it comes to memorizing poetry and grammar. My workplace is filled with these type of students. It's just that we put way too much pressure on students, I've had students who told me that their life was over if they failed at school which is bonkers you can have a perfectly happy and fulfilling life without an education. We also put too much emphasis on certain skills like Math or English and they're so poorly taught it's almost disrespectful to the field itself. Meanwhile there are areas that are left unexplored such as Drawing, Music, Writing, Dance, Comedy, etc just because we live in a society where people pursuing these skills are shunned up until they succeed.",

Some GMOs require less pesticide, but then things like BT resistance starts developing in bugs; nature is already in a constant biological arms race with itself, we're just forcing it to step up its game, similar to antibiotics. Like any industry there are people who follow the good ag practices and those who don't, in both the conventional and organic sector. But with proper GAP organic can have comparable yields with inputs as simple as plowed-in cover crops (aka nitrogen fixers) and manure, can avoid entire crops being ruined by maintaining a wide diversity of cultivars and proper multi-year crop rotation, can mitigate pest damage through the use of trap crops and beneficial predators. And there is plenty of research into organic pesticides, I don't know where you got that info from. Not as much as synthetic ones, sure, but to imply they're not safe has about as much basis in reality as claiming GMOs give you cancer (I have my issues with GMOs but that isn't one of them)",

                    "body": "A real, educated answer with concerns that a lot of Pro-GMO people never seem to address: First of all, there's the public perception problem that \"if humans messed with it, it's gunna fuck up\" which, while we have a track-record of doing exactly that with many technologies, GMO's haven't been shown to give us cancer. What is an *actual* issue, at least for me (currently studying Ag), is several fold. First of all, genetic diversity is severely lacking in conventional agriculture, GMO's don't help this whatsoever, mainly because its so expensive they tend to focus on a few select varieties that work well. Why is that an issue? Well for a real simple (if antiquated) example, look at the Irish Potato famine. That's what happens when an entire food system is built around 3 or 4 varieties of a vegetable: have a bad year and BAM, famine. This is compounded in monoculture by the fact that many conventional growers don't use any sort of crop rotation and plant the same thing year after year (there are plenty of conventional farms that follow GAP \"good agricultural practices\" such as crop rotation, but many don't) which leads to a build up of disease in the soil, which require further synthetic inputs to alleviate or your crop is fucked (again, BAM, famine). Another big problem is just the fact that conventional ag is heavily reliant on the fossil fuel industry, and GMO's buy into that industry heavily. Sure, fossil fuels aren't going anywhere in the near future, but pretty much all the science indicates we need to curve our CO2 output asap, but GMO's that are created to require less synthetic inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, are a band-aide fix at most, whereas there are other solutions to reduce inputs, such as rehabilitative soil practices that reintroduce depleted nutrients into the soil, keep it from erroding, and adequately control disease simply by following a strict crop rotation. Another issue is the socioeconomic problems that come with an increasing level of privatization of food / genetics. I mean on the one hand, these companies spend billions of dollars developing these products, and are therefor entitled to make a profit from them, however they flood many 3rd world markets with them (think of it like a lost-leader in a supermarket), again often removing genetic diversity from food systems, and requiring a shift in production that allegedly will come with higher yields (spoiler alert: it often doesn't) and require more expensive inputs than poorer farmers are used to paying. I think what really bothers me isn't GMOs themselves, but this idea that they're the end-all-be-all of agriculture, that humanity will live or die depending on our success with GMOs, when in reality there are plenty of alternatives to increasing production efficiency that would drastically benefit from further research. Sometimes the yields of GMOs are higher, sometimes they're not. Organic vs conventional can be equally destructive if GAP aren't followed, but organic farmers by and large *need* to follow GAP or their operation will simply fail. I guess a TL:DR would be GMOs are highly dependent on conventional agriculture and provide a short term fix for many of the problems that conventional ag is suffering from, but won't necessarily solve the problems in the long term, especially once the oil and gas industry can no longer sustain itself (which is likely to happen in our lifetime) I hope that's somewhat informative. I'm not 100% Anti-GMOs by any means. but to assume they'll solve all the problems our world faces when it comes to food security in the next 100 years is putting a lot of eggs into a rather rickety basket if you ask me. It's a tool like everything else, but when you ignore a wide variety of effective ones for one that is currently cheaper and more convenient, well you might end up having a bad time.

She graduated valedictorian of her class (after having to transfer colleges because her original one didn't allow married women to study, which seems insane in this day and age) and became a nurse. She only really worked to get herself out of the house, she made a hell of a lot less than what she would have as a man. (not that there were a lot of male nurses back then, but you get my point) She did stay with him, they actually both left their spouses for each other and remained together until he passed away. Their ashes are now interred together. I wasn't born when my grandparents divorced, but apparently my mother and her sister completely cut contact with her for years. They had a brother, but I don't know what his reaction was. (he was kind of the black sheep of the family, pretty sure he was in prison at the time and my mom and aunt didn't want much to do with him) My aunt didn't even tell her when my oldest cousin was born. My grandma only found out that she had a granddaughter by seeing her picture while visiting my grandfather's house. (they did remain on good terms, and my grandfather was very sick towards the end of his life so my grandma helped out a lot with his care) My mom only started talking to her again when she got pregnant with me, and then only because she thought I deserved to have a grandma, and she hadn't really done anything that would necessarily make her a bad grandma. I didn't really see them much when I was growing up, but that was more because they lived in a different state than us. They would visit together, my mom was cordial to him but I don't remember there being a lot of warmth there. I do remember referring to him as 'Grandpa Jim' once and my mom becoming absolutely *furious*. He technically wasn't my grandpa because they never got married, (had to do with their pensions, she would have lost hers if they married) but still. From that I think child me liked him, I remember him being fairly nice to us, but he passed away when I was still fairly young so it's not the most accurate remembering. My grandma did have another boyfriend after her partner passed, but it was more of a 'we would like a companion' thing that a real serious relationship. They never moved in together or anything and I didn't meet him until my grandma's funeral. My mom had a much better relationship with him, it seems. She still exchanges emails with him every few weeks. What's really noteworthy is that my mom completely stopped telling her mom she loved her...until a week or two before her death. Mom called grandma every week and grandma would say it, and the last two phone calls my mom said it back for reasons she really couldn't explain. I'm not really religious and neither is she, but we both agree that *something* was telling her that she didn't have much time left. She was glad she said it, after my grandma passed. I don't know if she ever fully forgave her, but she did a little bit. Sorry for the wall of text, I just think my grandma was kind of an interesting lady. She passed around two years ago and it's kind of a shame I wasn't able to ask her about all of this while she was around. I think her and her partner were selfish people, yes, but I also think their actions were partially a by-product of the time they came from. I see pictures of her and her partner and they look so happy. I can't help but feel happy they found each other. ",
