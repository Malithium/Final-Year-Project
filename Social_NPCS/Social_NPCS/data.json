It also provides for a lot of activities that you can't otherwise do like skiing/snowboarding, snowshoeing, ice skating (outdoors), sledding, ice-cave camping, etc.  \n\nYou have a time of year when people spend more time indoors, which makes for more intimate time with friends and family.  Nothing beats curling up by a warm fire with a hot drink and playing a board game together while it's snowing outside.  And when it's over, and the world warms up, it feels like an annual cycle of rebirth and revitalization.  It's amazing.  Plus, as others have mentioned, you then enjoy a warm summer with fewer bugs and weird tropical predators.\n\nAnd the trade off for all of this?  Turn up the heat, drive more slowly, and put on a coat.  I can handle that.\n\nEdit: OK everyone, please stop telling me that there are bugs where you live.  I said *FEWER* bugs.  If you think you have it bad during your Minnesota summer or whatever, go somewhere hot and humid and see what fresh hell you encounter.",

I like summer here, it's about as nice and warm as before and maybe there are far more sunny days, but you get something like four straight months of sunny days. It's nice, but by August you're like \"man, I can't WAIT for fall!\" You're already bored of summer.\n\nIn Canada, fall is a beautiful descent into the holiday season, with the leaves turning golden, orange, read, and brown, through Halloween into Thanksgiving getting cooler and cooler making everyone more cuddly and wrapped in soft comfy clothes. The season caps off in parties and family and friends and love, the end nestling you gently in a storybook Christmas setting with gentle snow making it (hopefully) the white Christmas that Bing Crosby kept going on and on about about. If you're middle-class, everything is warm fires and hot chocolate and snuggling together watching Netflix on the couch under a thick, warm blanket.\n\nThen it's mid-January. You've already fucked-up your New Year's resolutions so it's a granola bar for breakfast again, you have to get your ass to work on the bus and it's a half-hour late because the snowplows are on strike AGAIN and nobody can fucking drive in this goddamn country. February is shitty and freezing and transitions into March with wet and shitty slush everywhere so it's either ugly-ass rain boots that don't grip on ice, by the way, or hope you love wet socks for the entire day. It's been raining for basically a decade by now, I don't remember what the sky used to look like, and by the time all this shitty, dirt-and-garbage-covered snow has melted, great! All of the grass is dead and yellow and covered in every definition of the word \"refuse.\" Fuck April and May is also bullshit because it might be 10\u00b0C but you're wearing boots forever and \"spring\" may as well be completely made up, because there's flowers and shit but it's been cold and shitty for thousands of years now and you packed away your summer clothes so long ago you don't even remember what a polo is.\n\nFinally, when you least expect it...there's a random day in May when it's...all of the sudden...nice? The sun is shining and the grass has FINALLY started to perk up with a little green, and the tulips have started to bloom and people are suddenly outside, enjoying a Saturday morning in the park. You remember what warmth on your arms feels like for the first time in a while and you get the first face-sunburn because you've lived so long without touching a sunscreen it's like a monastic vow by now. Then you gradually get brought back into Summer World, where it gets dark at 9 PM instead of 5, where the sunsets are beautiful and there's so much to do and explore. There's beer on the patio and barbecuing and pool parties with friends and everything is amazing for a few beautiful months before September hits and you get to rediscover your love for jackets, hats, and fall all over again.",

It is not a feeling you get from 65-70 degree weather with no clouds and no wind.  I feel like I'm in a vacuum, that I'm part of a vacuum as well.

Poisonous spiders? Nope. Poisonous snakes? Nope. The worst we've got to deal with are bears and moose. \n\nI was born here, I'll probably stay here. My whole family lives here minus a couple relatives 8 hours away. So I live here because I don't feel like leaving anyways, and I don't want to deal with poisonous animals. \n\nEdit: Ok wow I've only been on Reddit less than a week, and this is already my biggest contribution. Let's talk a bit more about this then. I'm from Winnipeg. So yeah, you're right it is more like closer to half a year. And as far as I know, we've never had to worry about poisonous animals. I say the worst we have is bear and moose because when you live in Winnipeg, those aren't common, almost never being in the city. Have seen deer walk down my suburban neighborhood streets though. So I don't know if there's poisonous animals here. And on a side bar, you should try here in the summer, it's almost worse. It goes from -30 with wind chill, to +30 with humidity and jesus christ I think the weather wants to kill us. Plus mosquitoes man. Fuck mosquitoes, they're the worst thing to exist. \n\nOne last thing. You're right, it IS venomous things I'm worrying about. Thanks guys! ",

This means more money in income taxes to maintain the roads AND still more bumps so more suspension breaks in your cars leading to more replacement parts.\n\n4- You need to insulate your house a lot more, this is expensive.\n\n5- Heating bills are way higher than cooling ones (thermo pumps are around 3-4 times more efficient at cooling your house than heating it yet remains one of the most cost effective way to heat your house).\n\n6- Basements needs to be build more strongly (if at all compared to really hotter places) using more resistant materials that will inevitably breaks faster due to the temperature gradient between inside hot air and outside cold air.\n\n7- You need to buy a snowblower (or have someone come to open your driveway) and on top of that, clean up your roof manually if there is too much snow on it.\n\n8- Accidents are more common which leads to higher insurance, bad road conditions means longer commute (and maybe lost sales/warning from the job for being late).\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is a lot to love about winters. But it's a huge compromise too. It's not for everyone but for the people who learns to like it... it's usually something you wouldn't want to live without.",

You have a summer with lush green grass and blooming trees and swimming and bright skies, and then this completely different winter landscape with bare trees snaking against a pale sky in the morning, and then at night, a bright moon reflecting light off the snow, illuminating everything in a weirdly ethereal way. It's like getting to live in a different place for awhile without having to actually move. \n\nGoing for a walk at night, everything is silent except for snow crunching lightly under your feet, and maybe the sound of your own breath.. it's really quite amazing in some ways.\n\nI also love the first tinge of winter coming, when the air gets the post-autumn chill, and you step outside to breathe in cold air for the first time in months. \n\nPlus, everyone looks cuter after an afternoon of sledding or walking outside. Eyes are bright, cheeks are pink from the cold, and you're happy to get back inside warm and dry for board games and hot cocoa.\n\nAnd yeah, it also makes spring's arrival really awesome. Renewal, things coming back to live, thawing ice and melting snow, the hint of warmth. \n\nI love seasons.",

Or try some local grown meth at the mecca. Maybe meet a new friend in the rubber rooms at fmher. If you have any friends that are majoring in philosophy at uaf, you could always warm your feet in their honey bucket, or have them play you a song on their djembe. I seriously do miss it tho.\n\n**Edit**: I forgot to mention, that this is the only place where you can see the elusive Tundra Wookie in its natural habitat\n\n**Edit edit**: from other post:\n\nThere's no bad time of the year to visit Fairbanks. There always shit to do.\n\nFood. Where to start... Every Sunday you have Ivory Jack's making the best breakfasts with a jammin bloody marry. The rest of the time you can get bagel sandwiches at LuLus or the bar at Pikes. Not interested? There's half a dozen great local diners and you're not even in North Pole yet. Great pizza at college town or Thai House \"downtown\". Best dinners at pump house, gulch, or turtle club and the salmon bake in the summer. There's so many other places too. Bring money. This place isn't cheap. Too rich for your blood? No problem. Great alaska pizza is dirt cheap. The grande at azteca is enough for your whole family. And the food Factory is always greasy enough to fill.\n\nFood aside, there are endless trails. The roads all connect somewhere so go for a drive and play a game of Bunnies or Kittens. Head north to Chattanika or check out fairbanks falls. The lower the temperature gets, the better the hot springs feel. And there's nothing like a warm fire in a cozy cabin in the hills. Go to the cushman flats and shoot some guns. This is an nfa friendly state so bring your hand cannon with you. Kayak up the chena or ski at birch or moose.\n\nYou don't have to worry up here. No one will judge you for not knowing latest trends. Good people beget good people here and we all love to have fun. Everyone knows someone with a big offroad truck or a stash of pot, if you fancy. There are airboats, dog sleds, snow machines, four wheelers, planes, trains, and mud drags. Speaking of drag, we also have a Sams Club, and all the flavors of big chains if you prefer.\n\nThere's so much. I can't wait to move back.\n\n**Edit edit edit**: Bunnies or Kittens?\nSorry, it's a goofy game I made up in my younger days. Driver gets to an intersection, imagines one turn as Bunnies and the other as Kittens, and asks the passangers, \"Bunnies or Kittens?\"  Then the passengers, unaware of which way is Bunnies and which is Kittens, picks one and the driver must turn that way. Rinse, repeat, mix it up. You will learn new roads. You will see some shit. You will get to know your passengers. Fun times.",

It was excruciating, I would dread leaving the house, delay grocery shopping until the evening and basically never be outside. And I'm a moderately active, moderately outdoorsy person. I just couldn't do it. I was practically homebound during daylight hours on weekends and I would stay up late and sleep in just so I could be up during the night more and be more active as a result.\n\nGiven the choice I would rather endure the Michigan winters than South Carolina summers.

The contrast of pain and comfort is an addicting yet rewarding part of midwestern life that I can never give up.\n\nThis quote from *Moby Dick* sums it up quite nicely:\n\n\"To enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\"     ",

Then a half cool half hot night, a nice cool morning, and repeat by 1130/1200. \n\nEdit because I'm tired and English isn't my friend when I'm tired.",

After you're able to reach the seatbelt, there's so much fluff between you and the seat that you can't find where to click the belt on the other side. Nothing frustrates me more than having to layer up in the cold, because I lose every bit of dexterity that I have.

The bottom row consists of four small eyes, the middle row has two very large eyes (which distinguishes them from the\u00a0Pisauridae), and the top row has two medium-sized eyes. They depend on their excellent eyesight to hunt. They also possess an acute sense of touch.\"",

It's been 3 or 4 years now since we've been down below freezing, and we haven't even gotten into the 30s the past couple of years. Growing up here, coconut palms couldn't grow north of Fort Pierce, and now they grow as far north as Daytona along the coast. 10 years ago I couldn't use my pool between Halloween and March 1 even with solar heat, and now I can swim pretty much all year.\n\nOne cold winter or warm winter isn't indicative of global warming, but the trends are very noticeable here. Anecdotes and trends are what get people to pay attention. People that distrust science won't ignore their own experiences. Even the most right wing hardcore republicans I work with recognize that things have changed. They'll argue about whether it's caused by humans, but they recognize that things are different because it's impacting us directly.\n\nThe same goes for the now way too common flooding down in Miami Beach caused by rising sea levels.

She even watched a few episodes with me I had on VHS at my parent's home. She liked it, and thought the stories and themes were good. \n\nTrying to assuage my fears further, a few months later she surprised me with tickets for both of us to a Star Trek Convention that was coming to town.

His mother died six months after his first wife passed away, and to hear him tell it, it nearly broke him.  I think it healed his heart a little to talk about it, and I know that it made me love him even more somehow.  I'm just grateful that he was willing to open his heart up to love again.  He is an awesome man and the best thing that has ever happened to me.  Edit:  Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.  This one is for Dare Bear, for Debbie, and for me.  ",

I learned about her 3 months into our relationship.\n\nI had known about his younger daughter (different mothers)  from the start - he was very open about that. However he didn't know how to tell me about his eldest because it was going to be a difficult conversation. The mother of his eldest had taken off with her years ago & he had no idea how to find her.\n\nWithin a year of our dating we found her. It was very rough at first because she had been brought up being told that her father didn't care about her - typical parental alienation. Within the next 5 years her father & I got married and she opted to live with us. Now she is an adult, living her life on her terms & we are incredibly proud of her.\n\nEdited to  - wow, I'm amazed at how this blew up and how many people are in similar situations. Going to take advantage of that to ask a question of my own. Can any Canadian lawyers tell me the process I would need to legally adopt the adult child in question? I'm not rolling in cash so I'd like to save it for the actual legal fees instead of on asking the questions.",

As I reflected on old memories, like the mural we painted in first grade and the map of the United States painted on the blacktop, he had an a-ha moment and realized he did not in fact go to that school. He lived in another part of town so went to a different school, but continued to go along with it. On our one-year anniversary he admitted he actually went to the other school.

When we moved in together I was unpacking her stuff and I came across an old dingy onsy and a pacifier. I didn't wanna bring it up but last year we were laying in bed together and she just said she misses her so much even though they never met. I thought she had a miscarriage that she hadn't told me about but when I asked who thats when she told me. She says she dreams of her frequently. And she always feels like something's missing. Really sad. This was 3 years into our relationship. \n\nWhat she doesn't know is that for her birthday next month I'm surprising her with a portrait of her and her twin. Her mom already gave me the photo of them (last photo) \n\nI love you beans.",

He explained he learned it differently in Egypt..but you don't learn that until like freshman year. Other stuff just didn't add up. Finally the truth came out 6 or 7 months into our relationship when I was with him and his dad talking about how many schools he went to. I started counting them and was like \"So there was the elementary school in egypt..\" And his dad cut me off super confused and said he's never even been to egypt. So he hid his entire childhood from me and probably would've kept the lie going forever if i didn't find out. He had no reason to make that up either..I guess he just wanted to sound more interesting ",

She picks it randomly, I separated the deck into four stacks, and had her place her card on top of the stack of her choice. \n\nNow I do know a real trick that sets up like this, but I'm drunk and think it will be funny to mess it up on purpose. So instead of handling the cards I tell her to shuffle them all up and cut the deck. \n\nWhen the deck is in two stacks I tap the top card and say \"okay, there's your card.\"\n\nIt was her fucking card... Needless to say, I never did that trick again. ",

Last night I was there, she commented the salad dressing he'd made was a little on the sweet side. He grabbed the plate, threw it across the room and took off.\n\nMe and his wife got to talking and she made it clear that this was a pretty usual thing. Showed me all the things in the house that he'd damaged in anger. We drank a lot and I told her she deserved better.\n\nLast year, they got divorced. I'm so fucking thrilled for her.",

I work in a meat shop and it was cut fresh when I got it.  But I was kind of worried.  Steak turned out fine. She loved it.  Nothing happened that night.  Next morning I drive her to work and I had to stop to let her throw up like twice.  I felt horrible.  \n\nTurns out she was pregnant with someone else's kid. Last steak she ever got from me. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, stranger.

As it happens I was using a marked deck (from an earlier trick) so I knew what each person was drawing as we went along.\n\nFirst person picked the Jack of Diamonds. Second person picked the Jack of Spades. Third person picked the Jack of Clubs. Fourth person picked the Jack of Hearts. Completely by coincidence.\n\nSo I flipped over the deck and spread it to show that it was a fair deck, with different cards throughout, as I reiterated what we'd done: \"Four people pulled cards of their own free will from a shuffled deck...\" etc. \"... and yet there's a connection between these people: something that puts them in sync - something magical.\" Then I had each flip over the card they'd chosen, one by one. Mind-blowing. I skipped the trick I'd been planning on, in the end: taking credit for a 1-in-20,000 chance was, in the end, more impressive.\n\n**tl;dr: sometimes, being a magician means taking credit for coincidences**",

He has always enjoyed helping people and encouraging people to be their best, but he wasn't trying to make me into a different person. If I wanted help with something, he was there for me and has always been super duper supportive. He fell in love with me for me, and again offered his support with anything I wanted to change about myself for the better.\n\nI asked about the \"fixing\" thing because I admit that was something I tried doing in my last relationship and I got majorly burned for it. I tried helping my ex get his shit together; get his HS diploma, get his debts paid, and be a better person. Instead he yelled at me for nicely pushing him and fell back into drugs and became an abusive asshole. Screw that.",

I was 100% against it, myself.\n\nI was able to do quite a bit of growing on my own, what I needed a therapist for was to see a different perspective from someone who was a professional. Someone whose opinion I couldn't talk myself out of. \n\nThere's a lot of conditioning with serial abuse. What you might bring up to him: he could still be thinking in a way that is dangerous to him in the long run. Little things put there by the abuser to control a victim can really lead to self hatred and talking down to yourself. Having a professional tell you you're a good person is hard to ignore.\n\nThank you for the kind words. I honestly would love to talk to you. I have been trying to find people, like a support group, with no luck (as I don't want one based on religion). I'd like to talk with someone else who has a different experience with this/someone involved with this. I am also trying to work out all of the conditioning, so it helps to just talk.",

At least just until I finish the PhD. Then I can go back on them if I start to decline...\n\nBut that isn't how it works, and is why I am not stopping the meds. ",

I then, with the bear haul the mighty oak to the sacred carving ground and after weeks of blessing from mother fox and sister eagle, i build a longship. I then summon the strength of thor to push the longship into water and set the pen on an altar in the middle. I surround it with wreaths and gold, wine and weapons and finish with my 3rd cousin. After this is complete i fill it with straw and terapin for flammability.

The Airs are all plastic, no metal parts that I've found, which I love even more because you can travel with them even easier than other pens and they have the \"won't leak in flight\" guarantee like most Uni Ball pens.

                    "body": "Alright, tonight I\u2019m feeling a little salty, so I\u2019m gonna talk about why cartridges are pointless.\n\nFirst up, what is a cartridge? It\u2019s a disposable plastic vial of ink, sealed at the factory, intended for single-time usage in a pen. Cartridges were developed in the 60s and 70s as plastic manufacturing got cheaper and easier, as an alternative to traditional filling methods, such as the good old converter, the eyedropper method, et cetera.\n\nAt first glance, this seems like a pretty smart idea: rather than buying ink in a bottle and then filling your pen from it, you buy a cartridge, pop it in the pen, and go. Little mess, little cleaning, because you\u2019re generally staying within the ink range of the pen manufacturer, and it\u2019s easy to carry spare cartridges with you on the go.\n\nBut, let\u2019s look at what this really entails.\n\nCartridges are almost always proprietary to the pen brand. Parker, Lamy, Pilot, Platinum, Sheaffer, Aurora, Waterman, and more, all use a brand specific cartridge. These are some of the most popular, most widely used brands.\n\nThen, those brands only use their in-house, official ink, in their cartridges. Lamy makes only around 7 colors of ink. Parker only has 3. Sheaffer only sell a few of their colors in cartridges. Right now, there\u2019s probably somewhere around 750-1000 different, commercially sold colors of bottled fountain pen ink. When you stick to only using cartridges, you\u2019re limiting yourself to around 0.5% of the world\u2019s ink colors.\n\nAnd even if you love one pen maker\u2019s ink (like me and Lamy Turquoise, Parker Black, or Sheaffer Turquoise), most of them still sell it in bottles anyway, and you can use it in all of your pens, not just the ones they made themselves. Hell, even Sheaffer make the VFM, which for seemingly no reason whatsoever, takes the so-called \u201cStandard International\u201d size cartridges instead of their own proprietary size. Two pens from the same year from the same company, and they can\u2019t use the same parts. Why.\n\nThen, let\u2019s get into how much ink is even in a cartridge. Most of them run from .5mL to around 1mL per cartridge, and are usually sold in packs of 5-8. So, you\u2019re looking at paying around $5 for 4mL-5mL of ink. That\u2019s more than a dollar per milliliter. Let\u2019s look specifically at Lamy, because they\u2019re one of the most popular brands for beginning fountain pen users, and they don\u2019t include a converter by default.\n\nA 5 pack of Lamy cartridges contains around 5mL of ink and costs $5 dollars. In dollars per mL, that\u2019s a solid 1. If you buy the same color of ink from Lamy, but get it in bottled form, you get a 50mL bottle for $10.50, which is 21 cents per mL. It\u2019s five times cheaper to buy their own ink in a bottle than in a cartridge.\n\n\u201cBut wait, what about the converter?!\u201d you exclaim, because Lamy don\u2019t include them with many of their pens, including their best-selling Safari/Vista/Al-Star range. Ok, I\u2019ll bite. Let\u2019s add the cost of the converter to the cost of the bottle of ink, and see how that compares.\n\nLamy makes two models of converter, the Z24 and Z26. The former is $4.95, while the latter is 5 cents more, an even $5. For consistency\u2019s sake, we\u2019ll just use $5 for the cost of the converter, making the bottle/converter set cost $15.50.\n\nNow, that\u2019s $15.50 for 50mL of ink. Per mL, you\u2019re paying 31 cents, only 10 cents more per mL, still more than a third of the price of the cartridge per mL, and it\u2019s an extra charge you only have to pay once, because converters are designed to be reusable, repairable, and they\u2019re intended to last quite a while.\n\nNow back to cartridges. They\u2019re disposable. They have a one-time seal on them, and will leak once it\u2019s broken. Yes, it\u2019s possible to refill a cartridge, but the fitting to the pen will wear out after about 4 or 5 fills, meaning it\u2019s nearly completely useless. And now you\u2019re stuck with an empty, non-biodegradable chunk of plastic. Yes, you can chuck it in recycling, but if there\u2019s any residual ink in there, some places will wind up throwing it out anyway. That\u2019s wasteful.\n\nQuite a lot of pen manufacturers realize this, and include some form of converter with their pens. Parker throw in a simple slide converter. Pilot and Hero include a little squeeze converter that, while ugly and slightly fragile, do the job very, very well. Plus, converters are supremely useful when it comes to flushing a pen with water, the cornerstone of pen maintenance. Even for the more expensive converters, it\u2019s a $10 investment that opens up the ink selection, keeps your pen running smoothly, and prevents any more unnecessary plastic waste.\n\nI love fountain pens because I have so much room to choose what ink I use, how finely or broadly I want to write, and how easily serviced they are. Many pens allow for nibs to be swapped out, meaning you have near-complete control over your writing experience. Nothing is inherently wasted. Nibs can be swapped, repaired, and modified, so they never lose usefulness. Pens can be tuned and repaired simply, so they\u2019ll keep working for decades. Ink bottles are all glass, which is still the most economical substance to recycle. And ink gets pretty cheap, especially when you buy it in bottles.\n\nCartridges ruin most of that efficiency and functionality by adding excess waste to the process, and then charging more for it. There\u2019s no point. Cartridges, go home!\n\n[Source](http://penguinsandpaper.tumblr.com/post/103242983982/why-fountain-pen-cartridges-are-pointless-a-rant)",

I would suggest a budget of 50-150$ for a first pen, but that is just because in my experience that is where I have gotten some really good deals and very nice writing experiences.\nItalix-The Parson's Essential A nice budget pen, it is made to be a workhorse, nothing fancy but they make sure the nibs are super smooth and it's a really good choice if you want an italic nib.\nEversharp-Symphony This pen is a vintage pen with semi-flex, still more flexible than most modern pens and will give you some line variation, it looks really nice, very classic and is what I see in my head when I think of fountain pens.\nLamy-Al-star A really popular first fountain pen, comes in different colors, very decent pen and the favourite of many.\nNoodler's Ahab A modern budget flex pen, it's nothing fancy, but might be a good starting point and introduction to fountain pens.\nPilot Falcon A bit more expensive, but I like this pen alot, offers decent line variation and looks really nice, also a favourite of many.\nLamy 2000 This is my own personal favourite, also a bit more pricey, but it offers decent line variation and is pretty versatile, looks very nice but understated, a very good work horse pen, also a favourite of many.\nTWSBI Diamond 580 This is a very nice pen at a budget also, there are many TWSBI fans, most people I know that are into fountain pens love this pen and the TWSBI brand.\nHope this helps.",

Comes with converter.          \nUp one level: Sheaffer VFM or Pilot Metropolitan : pretty cheap (both ~15$) and still are fairly nice writers. Only the metro comes with a converter.             \nUp one: Noodler's ahab/konrad : fairly cheap (16-20$) but have flex nibs. Really only used for prettier more fancy writing than actual daily stuff. Both Piston fillers, no converter needed.           \nUp one: TWSBI eco/Lamy safari : A little more expensive (~30$) but are much better than previous pens. Lamy is a workhorse and the TWSBI is more convenient for cleaning and filling (and prettier). TWSBI eco is piston filler, lamy safari doesn't come with converter (i think)         \nInks!            \nNoodlers: Cheap and have good shading (color changing when writing) and come in a lot of colors. A little dry compared to other inks.          \nDiamine: Cheap and also have good shading, less than Noodler's, but still a good bit. Much smoother. Some shine a different color in good light (called sheen)             \nMonteverde: A little more expensive, but they have fair shading and nice sheen. Smoother than Diamine.           \nJ.Herbin: A tad expensive. Some shading. Bright sheen (in the 1670 series) and a lot of gold dust/shimmer. Smoother than Monteverde (debatable)                       \nMontblanc: Prices vary a lot. Nice shading. Fairly nice sheen, but not as noticeable as J.herbin or Monteverde. Not much shimmer/gold. Really smooth.               \nPilot Iroshizuku: More expensive. Incredible shading. Some have sheens. No gold/shimmer. Very smooth.             \nThis is in order of quality (imo).   \nGood resources: https://www.gouletpens.com , /r/fountainpens , http://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/              \nEdit: forgot paper!          \nMead notebook paper: Surprisingly good for price. Shimmer and sheen are fairly visible. Cheap.               \nRhodia: Pretty good. Shimmer and sheen are very visible. Tad bit more expensive.           \nTomoe river: Very nice. Shimmer and sheen are extremely visible. Most expensive.                 \nNOTE: only really covers the more popular brands, sorry :\\\n",

I much prefer my LAMY Al Star when writing for longer periods of time, and it writes smoother since I don't have to be so careful about getting the stub to hit the paper at the right angle. The big plus about the TWSBI is the piston filler. I've refilled it twice in a year (again I usually don't use it for notes which is when I write the most so maybe that's not typical). However, I like being able to use all my different inks and for that reason I don't mind my other pens that don't hold as much. That just means I get to use a new ink sooner.

Went from face full of acne, kinda chunky, bushy eyebrows, messy hair, braces, and ugly wire rim glasses, and ugly baggy clothes to a normal human being.\n\nPeople actually wanted to start hanging out with me. And people would start liking pictures of me on FB and commenting with things like \"you look great\". And people smiling at me and being nicer in public. And people who I used to think were super cool wanting to hang out with me. And guys stopped wanting to be \"just friends\" or \"you're like a sister\" and wanting to date me.\n\nPros: flattering, confidence booster.\n\nCons: How the fuck do I deal with this? I was butt ugly until my early 20s when I started to work and learned how to get my shit together because I wasn't getting hired otherwise. I was so ugly I remember walking past frat row in college and hearing the guys say I was like a negative while the fat chick in front got at least a 2 since she \"had a nice face\".\n\nNormal guys get nervous and start edging away when they find out I'm mid 20s and never even been in a relationship before. Much less dated or did couply stuff like hold hands, or even kiss.\n\nLet that sink in. I was so fucking ugly through HS and college, even the gaming/anime/nerdy guys were friend-zoning me and sister-zoning me.\n\nSo now I have no idea how to deal with the normal relationships that everyone else learned how when they were still students. And I'm supposed to be an adult.",

I also feel like my interest in video games makes me more attractive to guys now, which is weird because before that's what made me the weird kid.\n\n\nPros are that I'm *much* more confident now. I feel okay saying no to people when before I would hesitate and agree to anything. I've also noticed that I actually care *less* what people think of me now. I'm totally comfortable going out dressed down, with no makeup and messy hair, which was hard for me before.\n\n\nCons are of course people tend to judge that I'm bitchy or unapproachable before talking to me. Also, the constant cat calling gets really annoying, and for once I wish I could just have a good male friend that isn't secretly trying to have sex with me. It's a little degrading.",

That's also the worst part, too, actually. I'm a quiet person, and apparently, it comes across as arrogance. I'm not disinterested, I'm just terrified I'm going to fuck up this conversation.\n\nThe other thing is that people think I'm dumb. I have an advanced degree from one of the best programs for my field of study in the world. I've got a great career. But my work involves interviewing people and I get treated like like a shallow idiot (also, because I'm a gay guy.) But, this also works in my favor.

At that point, I transform into either a *really* attractive guy or an utter buffoon, and determining which will win out is kind of a crap-shoot.\n\nThat, to my mind, is the thing that many \"average-looking\" folks seem to forget about being physically attractive. Sure, there's the *appearance* of having more opportunities when you're easy on the eyes, but by the same virtue, there are also more ways for things to end in an utter train-wreck.\n\nFor example, there was a time when I was hanging out at a club I used to frequent, and a young (attractive) woman walked up to me with a remark on how good I looked. I politely thanked her, returned the compliment, and then asked if she'd like to get a drink with me.\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" the girl replied, \"but I don't drink.\"\n\nI shrugged and offered what I hoped was a charming smile. \"Well, if you'd like, I could buy you something non-alcoholic.\"\n\n\"How about,\" she said, \"you just get your own drink and then meet me at a table so we can talk?\"\n\n\"Nah, I don't need a drink!\" I replied. \"That's just what people do, right? Buy each other drinks?\"\n\nThe young woman eyed me with the beginnings of suspicion. \"So, what? You don't want to talk to me?\"\n\n\"No, no, that's not what I...\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" snarled the girl, interrupting me. \"Were you expecting *me* to buy the drinks?\"\n\nMy response probably sounded rather like a frog with a stutter, and by the time I managed to regain control of my tongue, the young woman had walked away.\n\nNow, that may *sound* like it wasn't entirely my fault, or like the girl in question was someone best avoided anyway... but believe me when I say that I was the one to blame. My tone of voice, my meter, and even the broadness of my grin all probably made me look more like a handsome idiot than a decent date. I've played over that moment - and dozens like it - again and again in my head, and each time I invent new things that I *should have* said or done. Worse still is the fact that I never seem to learn from my mistakes, and my sense of humor is just as likely to make someone raise an eyebrow as it is to make them laugh.\n\nWhen everything is said and done, it's really personality that counts. Being attractive gets you in the door, of course, but you'll get kicked right back out again unless you manage to keep from messing things up.\n\n**TL;DR: Attractiveness affords opportunities, but they're still easy to blow.**",

                    "body": "When I was a kid strangers used to ask to take pictures with me or approach my mother and ask if they could pay for my lollies/ice cream/theme park ride/toy/book.  I was always the teacher's pet and would get perfect grades. I was the most popular girl in my grade and everyone would agree with everything that I said and want to be my friend. I knew this wasn't what \"normal\" kids experienced but I figured it was okay as long as I wasn't an arsehole. \n\nBut people would also say weird shit to me, too. At a primary school dance a concerned mother approached me and told me I looked like Jon Brent Ramsey and should be careful, because Jon Benet was a good example of what happens to girls who are too pretty. I was molested on numerous occasions as a child by both people I knew and strangers. \n\nI wasn't cute when I hit puberty. I had acne, frizzy hair and was overweight. I suddenly had a very clear picture of what life was like for people who weren't utterly adorable. Honestly, it wasn't as bad as I imagined it was. People spent more time actually talking to me, instead of agreeing with everything I said. I had to learn how to work hard for the things that I got instead of being handed things on a platter. I saw my friends enduring the horrible way boys would treat them and I didn't want for a second of it. \n\nThen I lost all my puppy fat, my skin cleared up and I learned how to do my hair and makeup. Suddenly, people were interested in me again. \n\nPros:\nPeople immediately like me and want to be my friend. I make a great first impression. I have never interviewed for a job that I haven't been offered. I'm the life of the party where ever I go. \n\nWhen I worked in hospitality while I was at uni, I made enough in tips to never have to touch my wages. I could pay rent and living expenses in cash. \n\nI don't get catcalled, except a few times in Italy. Sometimes people will stop me to tell me they hope I have a lovely day or that I have a beautiful smile, but they're always respectful. I have seen some of my friends get catcalled, and I consider this a huge pro, because I couldn't cope with that shit. \n\nPeople go out of their way for me constantly. We're talking bus drivers stopping in the middle of the street to let me cross illegally with a wave and a tip of the hat. I once had a bartender run five blocks to buy a bottle of my favourite gin for me out of his own pocket because they'd run out. I also once had a chef in a 5-star restaurant personally deliver me my entree when I'd ordered off menu because he just \"had to see the pretty girl\", and then they didn't even charge me for it. I constantly get upgraded. \n\nI can't even estimate how much booze and food I have gotten for free. \n\nI had a 100% hit rate on Tinder and over 10,000 matches in less than a year before I deleted the app. \n\nCons:\nPeople make eye contact constantly and I am always catching people staring at me. I am a very shy person, so this makes me uncomfortable. Men have come up to me in the street and admitted to \"watching me from afar\" for weeks. It's not nice to feel like you're constantly being watched. \n\nDating is hard, because people tend to be on their \"best behaviour\" to try and \"catch\" me, and then I discover I'm dating some complete stranger I don't know. The kind of men I'm attracted to are very rarely the first approach me, so I always have to be the one to throw myself out there. Almost everyone I have dated long-term has become insecure from the \"she's out of your league\" comments. I've never been turned down for sex or dates, though, which is nice. \n\nPeople don't take me as seriously in my job. I am always trotted out at client meetings, but it is almost always as eye candy. I'm practically laughed out of the door any time I try to run a meeting, until I explain that it's my meeting. Coworkers, clients and suppliers are constantly unprofessional towards me. I have lost clients because they have asked me out on dates and then been embarrassed when I've declined. \n\nSometimes I feel like people are only friends with me for the perks, like free drinks and upgrades and stuff. \n\nWhen I'm talking to, say, 50% of dudes, I can literally feel men imagining what it's like to have sex with me. \n\nI know one day it'll fade and people will go back to treating me the way they did when I was an average-looking teen. I constantly have to remind myself not to get big-headed and to appreciate everything that I have now before it's gone. ",

Here is what I've noticed:\n\n* He has no idea when he gets advantages because he's good looking (as he has always been beautiful). But it happens all the friggin' time. Like a farmer once gave me a flat of strawberries for free because of him.\n* He gets more chances than most kids. People will just keep letting him try again. Admittedly he is athletic too, so I'm not sure if it's his looks or his athleticism, but he had burned many bridges with crap behavior with friends. Nevertheless, they come back and still want to be buddies.\n* He is expected to be confident and a leader, so he fakes the part when he needs to. Honestly, he probably is a natural leader, but he's 14 years old -- he's not really confident. He just knows that people expect him to be, so he tries.\n* Weird people stop us to comment about his looks. The worst was when he was about seven and I caught a stranger taking pictures of him in the grocery store because \"his eyes are so beautiful.\" WTF?!\n\nThe worst for me is that almost no one comments on my daughter's looks. Now, I don't place any emphasis on attractiveness (remember, I look a bit like a homeless person), but it irks the hell out of me when the three of us are together and someone says how good looking my son is and ignores my daughter. And that happens A LOT. Thanks, assholes, way to make a 12 year old girl more insecure.\n",

There were several distinct realizations that took place:\n\n- when got with someone I had wanted for a long time, THEY got all the high-fives.  I was like wait... was I the catch in this equation?\n\n- I was forgiven for a variety of indiscretions I myself considered hard to forgive, and the forgiveness in several cases came in the form of additional indiscretions.\n\n- most of my close friends were of the opposite gender and they always HATED my new SO's.  I never understood it and wondered if I had bad taste in friends or partners.  Finally I was venting to another friend who pointed out, as though it was obvious, that my other friends wanted me for themselves.  My reaction was essentially \"oh.....OHHHHH............*ohhhhhhhh*...........\"  See also: indiscretions.\n\nPros: everyone makes mistakes in their 20's, and apparently it's easier to be forgiven when you have something people want.  it's fun to catch people looking sometimes.  people smile on the street and are kinder.  I don't have to flee from cameras anymore and when I get my hair styled or put extra time into my outfit etc, people really notice.\n\nCons: getting away with shitty behavior does not bring peace of mind.  you still have to forgive yourself, which is harder.  Also after marriage, I've found it harder to maintain friendships with members of the opposite gender, and people make a lot more assumptions about what I'm looking for.

I'm a senior at a really great university, and any time a customer asks where I go to school, they never believe me, which was discouraging in the past, but I've learned to..handle myself better now haha. I'm also a Spanish major, and am often dismissed by native speakers, but of course not by all native speakers I've encountered, just want to make that clear! A big con for me is when going on a date with someone I'm actually interested in, I often can't tell if they're actually interested in me, or if they're just trying to fuck me. ",

My sex life has always been fulfilling and I've never had a shortage of men willing to be with me. \n\nCons: People will often only see you for your looks. I've had a lot of relationships with women go sour after they say something like \"I wish I was as thin/pretty/confident as you are.\" It puts the friendship in a weird place and usually once this happens I have a hard time remaining friends with someone because I feel guilty. \nMen will be super gross to you. Just yesterday I was in a very crowded elevator and an older man who reeked of booze started whispering gross shit in my ear. No one did anything to stop him. Things like this occur very often and it's absolutely disgusting and can also be very scary if you are alone. \nPeople will not take you seriously and will assume you are stupid. They will question your work ethic and assume you've always coasted on being pretty. This is easily the most outraging thing.

I guess I expected there to be more objective signs of girls being attracted to me when in reality people act pretty much the same when you reach a certain level which at the beginning was a bit disappointing to my past ugly self. \n- A big con is that sometimes at work or at school it's hard to have some females take things seriously when I'm around. They become so overly giggly that even I notice it. Then it's just embarrassing to me because I feel like everyone is realizing what's going on. \n- Another con, attention from gay guys when you're straight as an arrow. ",

This came when I was becoming more confident in who I was and how I wanted to look and dress too.\n\n**Pros**: obvious - people pay you mind in many ways. You can strike up conversations, friendships, etc. with strangers quite easily. The ego boosts that come from strangers admiring you rarely gets old.\n\nThe occasional free/discounted drink at bars from smiling, flirty bartenders is awesome. I also feel, as someone in an academic area, people seem more drawn to the confidence / charisma that goes with male attractiveness. \n\n**Cons**: the pressure to feel like you've always got to look good is frustrating. I never leave home without being very aware of how I'm dressed / styled. The attention, while nowhere near as unwanted as even an average looking girl, is sometimes annoying. Especially looking good and kind of weird / different - random people will touch me or interrupt whatever I'm doing almost every day.\n\nThis isn't an isolated negative, but tied in my depression / mental health issues, I'll sometimes fall into the spiral of thinking compliments and attention to my physicality erase the internalised worth I've established for who I feel I am as a person, which leaves me feeling empty and miserable sometimes. \n\n",

They would then go over, essentially, the who's who of those considered attractive, unattractive, and social pariahs. I had slipped somewhere between the second and third group back in grade 2, and because this information was heavily a popularity contest crossed with handed down tradition I never moved in that ranking. \n\nI didn't go to college, but once I got out into the workforce I suddenly got a lot of attention I didn't know how to handle. All of the sudden it was \"those first couple days\", but all the time. I probably had more sex in those first couple years than I have had before or since. Combined. \n\nIt wasn't a good thing.

Then one day, we were getting ice cream but paying separately because we had individual groupons and we are cheap... so it didn't necessarily look like we we together once at the front of the line. The ice cream guy was pretty flamboyant and obviously gay, and he started flirting with my husband who was a really good sport about it. But now whenever a girl hits on my husband, I just look around at whatever good looking guy is within eyesight and ask him if he thinks that guy is into him too. My husband doesn't care either way, but it makes me feel better anyway since he reacts the same to guys or girls even though he's straight, so i feel secure he's all right with his life choices. Ps still friends with the ice cream guy.",

You know how when you're a kid, you see all the age 25+ people and you assume since they're adults surely they have life figured out and are mature, responsible huamns? Then as you start to get older, you realize more and more that a lot of these people have no idea what they're doing and you notice they make all kinds of terrible life choices? That's pretty much how dating is too.\n\nThere's going to be some stuff that gives you anxiety and makes you nervous, that's unavoidable but just from reading one of post of yours and seeing that you can be both introspective and honest with yourself, you're on a good path. \n\nUltimately you want to find someone you're attracted to and compatible with, so continue to be honest about what you want, what works and what doesn't, and encourage whoever you're seeing to give you feedback on things they think would help improve your relationship too. You can't fix something if one of the people isn't aware something is an issue right?\n\nThere will also still be plenty of people in their late 20s who are saying they have no idea how to be adults still so don't worry too much.\n",

Much less dated or did couply stuff like hold hands, or even kiss.\n\nI was also a very ugly teenager with no confidence and no idea how to present myself. I went through a similar thing where I had to discover - between the ages of 20 and 25 - how to dress, how to do my hair, how to wear makeup, etc. This past year was the first year when I felt like I was close to passing as a \"normal\" woman. I'm still not great looking, and the confidence is still a problem, but I'm not super ugly either, and I take good care of myself, which definitely helps. \n\nI too had the \"what now?\" moment, when I finished my protracted personal makeover and realized I had NO IDEA how to date. I had kissed two guys and had sex with one, but in both cases it was rather reluctant on my part, more an act of \"better get this over with and learn how to do it\" than an act of passion. So I had some pretty negative feelings about dating, and I totally empathize with feeling lost. \n\nI found that the thing that helped me the most was just going out on dates. I used online dating and challenged myself to just go on some \"first dates,\" without over-thinking things, without expecting perfection, and with the notion in mind that I was in control and could jump ship whenever I wanted. The great thing about online dating is that you can make it clear in your profile that you have no experience in relationships, and weed out the guys who have a problem with that. I went out a few times, and each time it got easier. A few months ago I went on a date with someone who I definitely thought was \"out of my league\" - both intellectually and in the looks department - and we really hit it off. And here's the thing: he's a normal guy, and he didn't edge away from me, even when he began to discover just how awkward I am about dating. Turns out, there are men out there who were \"ugly ducklings\" as well - men who had a similar journey as you and I and feel just as lost in all of this. Neither of us knows what we are doing, and it is great. I won't pretend it isn't awkward or uncomfortable at times, trying to navigate things, but dating is always going to be awkward and uncomfortable for various reasons - even for those who are \"good at it.\"\n\nAnyways, I thought you might find that encouraging. I won't pretend that I have any advice, besides keep doing what you are doing and don't discount the men who are also a little lost.\n\nps: I wrote this as a reaction to the person who suggested lying. That was probably a joke, but nobody should feel the need to lie about their dating history. Besides being morally questionable, it doesn't work well anyways...",

We've been together for 2.5 years, you really think that's just going away for a chance at someone I might not even work with? Screw that.\n\nGood luck finding decent people for friends! Upside is that if you find them they don't end up trying to screw you, so you can keep them!",

If you like him and he's good looking, he is bolstered by your level and wants to go a level higher i.e. good looking men turn right around and do it to you too. That's not even to touch on all the less attractive men who refuse to let themselves believe you even want to date them. I dated a guy who ghosted me, I assume because he figured I would never settle down with him. He went out and found a girl to date who looks JUST LIKE ME, except the poor man's version. I will never stop being pissed off about that. (\"Never\" being a relative term.)\n\nIt's almost impossible to avoid feeling like you \"settled\" for a guy that is less attractive than you. And yes, you can get over it, but it's usually a big psychological thing to work through and depending on your level of humility, it will take a long time to do it. ",

                    "body": "You've likely heard that the way in which you say something is often more important than the words themselves. While that's true, it's also a bit of an oversimplification. Communication - particularly of the verbal variety - relies on three different elements for effectiveness. Those elements are as follows:\n\n\\- The tone and mannerisms you use while speaking.    \n\\- The words themselves.    \n\\- Any biases or assumptions held by the listener.\n\nMost people are intimately aware of how the first and second details can affect an exchange. The third one isn't exactly a secret, either, but it's often approached in a way that's ultimately detrimental.\n\nLet's use my above scenario as an example.\n\n------\n\n**WOMAN:** I am expressing interest in conversing with you.    \n**ME:** I am responding with interest of my own. May I purchase a beverage for you?    \n**WOMAN:** I anticipated your offer, and I am going to decline without rejecting you.    \n**ME:** I am going to foolishly fixate on the beverage aspect of this conversation, as opposed to your interest.    \n**WOMAN:** I am concerned that your previous compliment was just politeness. If you are truly interested in conversing, please accompany me to an environment that is more conducive to it.    \n**ME:** Being that I am an idiot, I am going to continue fixating on the beverage question, and inform you of this with a negative response.    \n**WOMAN:** I am beginning to feel hurt by what I perceive to be either rudeness or entitlement. I am also disappointed that my initial impression of you as a prospective mate has been rendered apparently inaccurate.    \n**ME:** Sputtering protocol engaged.    \n**WOMAN:** My displeasure is now visible, but as I have yet to leave, my presence should inform you that I am holding out some last vestiges of interest.    \n**ME:** Initiating croaking sequence.    \n**WOMAN:** Goodbye.\n\n------\n\nIn short, I spent the entire exchange focusing on the wrong detail, even though that was the apparent purpose of the conversation. By adding a negative element to what *looked* like a lack of interest (or even a lack of empathy), I painted myself as being a rather aloof and unapproachable individual, and I wound up making everything worse by stumbling over my own tongue.\n\nNow, I don't know your precise situation with your mother, but it sounds to me like she's expecting more than just a to-the-letter following of her instructions. When she says \"I want you to change your tone,\" what she likely *means* is \"I want to feel like you genuinely care about me.\" She (and you) might focus on the specific detail, but it's the underlying desire that's actually important. Rather than just listening to your mother's directions and meeting her demands, try asking about those core emotions. When you offer reassurance, make an attempt addressing the need itself, not just its symptom.\n\nIt won't always work (hell, it can even cause a few more fights), but the effort and attention will go a long way.\n\nAs another example, here's how my exchange *should have* gone:\n\n------\n\n**WOMAN:** I am expressing interest in conversing with you.    \n**ME:** I am responding with interest of my own. May I purchase a beverage for you?    \n**WOMAN:** I anticipated your offer, and I am going to decline without rejecting you.    \n**ME:** I will now invite you to a different location of this establishment.    \n**WOMAN:** I accept your invitation, and will now insinuate that copulation between us is a possibility.    \n**ME:** Sputtering protocol engaged.\n\n------\n\n**TL;DR: Ask what the core emotion behind any exchange might be, and you'll be a better communicator.**",

Dating easy mode.\n\n* Average looking/high confidence/charisma --> have to work for it, but often highly successful. Usually higher charisma than the above category.\n\n\n* Good looking/subpar-low confidence/charisma --> occasionally get lucky, but usually frustrated and unable to take their chances.\n\n* Average looking/subpar low confidence --> same as above, although with slightly less hope and less luck. \n\n* Below average looking/high confidence/charisma --> deal with rejection a lot, but don't give a fuck...prob get laid more than the above two.\n\n\n* Below average looking/subpar-confidence/charisma --> a tough deal. dating on permanent hard mode. \n\n(Of course big generalizations.

I think if you're in a relationship and feel like you're settling, it's not a healthy relationship and it'll never be successful.

Laser eye contact!   \n- I can approach people without over analyzing every little thing I'm going to say to them.   \n- When I'm talking to people I don't shake anymore and look like I'm dying inside. I give them a big ol' nice smile!      \n   \nI still have a lot to learn but I'm getting better. Easier said than done? Ha! It's literally just willpower, the willpower to take action and break out of your comfort zone. The first time I went up to a random stranger to talk with them it was super awkward, but I don't regret it. Because it's those awkward conversations which got me to where I am now.   \n   \n**TL;DR** Buck up, take action, and have the willpower to succeed through failure.",

Which is possibly when the something else first started becoming a thing.\n\nBut for real, washing your face isn't gonna take care of the dime sized painful lump sitting underneath all the superficial layers of skin. It's there and it hurts and it's not gonna budge for some fuckin' salicylic acid, peroxide, AHA, or anything short of Acutane. I'm not desperate enough to prove to docs for a year ish that I'm not pregnant and I'm not about to be pregnant anytime soon so I can be on Acutane.",
