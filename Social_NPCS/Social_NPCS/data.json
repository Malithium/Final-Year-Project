I was about twenty meters off the ground when I reached what I thought was the top. Turned out the top was still going upwards, and the surface was smooth as a baby's bottom, with nothing to grab on to. I tried to descend, but got myself stuck. After a few minutes I couldn't hold on any longer, I lost my grip, and I fell. I dropped 5 meteres, and by chance, two tiny trees, growing out from a crack in the mountain, caught me. And they did so perfectly, one under my arm, and the other right under one of my knees. From there I found my way down again, safe and sound. If it hadn't been for those trees, I could have been seriously injured, or dead as the ground underneath was littered with pointy rocks. I didn't use my luck to win the lottery, but it saved me from a real bad situation.",

So being the smart person I am, I went into the gas station and bought a dollar scratch off lottery ticket. I wound up winning twenty dollars, filled up my car, and made it home. Edit: Most of my luck appears to revolve around gas and college, so here are a couple extra stories. Extra Story 1: There was another time I was at the gas pump digging around in my middle console looking for change. A guy wearing a faculty badge from my college knocks on my window, and I roll it down a bit. He says, \"Are you trying to get gas?\", and I replied, \"Yeah, but I've got some change so I should be alright\". He then drops a twenty dollar bill through my window and says, \"Use this\", and walks away. I called out the window after him, \"Are you sure?!\", and he grumpily says, \"If I wasn't sure I wouldn't have given it to you, would I!?\". Extra Story 2: I was heading home again from college. I walked in to the gas station, I put down my three dollars in change and asked for it on pump 3. The gas station attendant asked where I was going, and I replied \"I'm just trying to get home\". He took my change and said, \"Go ahead and fill up you car. It's on me\". Edit 2: To those asking, no, I am not a woman. People were just especially generous. I had to pay my own way through college, so all my money went towards classes and textbooks. I often had to decided between eating, or getting gas. Thankfully, college paid off and I now have an awesome job, zero debt, and a full tank of gas. And yes, I realize it was dumb to try and drive, but hey, I was just a kid. Edit 3: Sorry for all the edits, but this will be my last one. If you were once struggling to pay for gas or meals like me, and you find yourself in a much better place financially down the line, try to be like the people that helped me out. Pay it forward. Whatever you do, be it paying for someone's gas, buying the homeless man at the gas station some juice, or secretly paying for someone's meal, their day will be a little bit better, and you will be surprised at the amount of joy that it brings you.",

We were in a suburban traveling on the freeway when someone fish tailed us and we spun into the median, and then started rolling. I somehow slid out of my seat belt and flew out the passenger window landing in front of the suburban. When it got to where I landed, it bounced over me, and then continued to roll. Eye witnesses say that is the only time the suburban ever left the ground. In the aftermath, my sister, my gf at the time, and myself all needed to be intubated, as our ribs had punctured our lungs and we were drowning in our own blood. There happened to be 3 separate, unrelated EMTs behind us that all pulled over, had medical equipment in their vehicles, and intubated us until ambulances and star flight showed up. So I'd say the bounce, and the random EMT's behind us would be the best luck I've ever had. Edit: [Couple pictures of the suburban at the junk yard if you want to see.](http://imgur.com/a/k6vud)",

Also, my last name is obviously non-white. This will be important later. This was back in the mid 2000s when I was a senior in undergrad. I held a scholarship worth $5000/year from 1st year onwards, and one of the conditions of me keeping the scholarship from year to year was maintaining a high enough GPA (somewhere between an A and A-). Well, in 3rd year my GPA was just below the threshold so I ended up losing it for my final year. However, there was an appeals process you could write a letter to, arguing your case for why you should get your scholarship back. So I wrote this letter coming up with as much bullshit as I could muster. I was a math major, so I was taking harder classes than average. My GPA was well above the threshold the last two years so this was only a blip. My girlfriend was going through personal problems during the year so I spent a lot of time/energy supporting her. Probably a few more points, but they were the biggies. Turns out my brother had a friend who was the student rep on the scholarship appeals committee. My bro said that he'd get his friend to do all she could to reinstate my scholarship. It probably couldn't be anything drastic, but she said she'd try and steer the discussion of the decision in a positive direction. A few weeks later, they mail me a cheque for 5 grand and congratulate me on retaining my scholarship. Rad! So I invite my brothers friend for a coffee to thank her. But it turned out she had *nothing* to do with the decision. Turns out that the committee members thought I was a girl. \"Oh look at this girl who just missed out on her scholarship. She's a math major too. We want to support women in science so we should really consider her case. Oh look, and she has a girlfriend! How can we not support an LGBT woman in science. She's such a role model for other queer women. And look at her last name! Shes a visible minority too! Let's support her as much as we can!\" Apparently there was even a discussion about *increasing* my scholarship too! My brothers friend had to subtly kibosh that for my own good. Best they didn't find out the truth ;) Tl;Dr: A committee thought I was a lesbian and gave me $5000 because of it. ",

Took first place for $1500. Being \"responsible\" I went and put $1,000 in my bank and kept $500 to play with. The next night, I go to a craps table with $200 and I go on for about a 45 min roll. This was at the Paris where they have the \"firebet\" which is a $10 bet that if you hit all 6 points its 1000-1. I hit that over the course of the 45 minutes, and, if you know anything about craps, it becomes exponential as you press your wins, so starting with a typical $10 pass line and $20 odds and like $12 on a 6 or 8--- by the time I finally 7'ed out I had $500 on each number and was hitting them over and over- Cashed out with $28,000. The final night, I did it again- just went on a 30 min run, hit another fire bet but since I was up so much I had started at a $25 min game, another $18,000. I basically parleyed $50 into $46,000 which was more than my annual pay at the time. That will never happen again.",

Now everywhere we went on patrol we had the first guy \"sweeping\" with a metal detector looking for signs of IEDs, and this night was no exception. When we got to a good vantage point we were designated spots, and as I was carrying a SAW, I was placed on a berm facing down a road/trail that led up the hill. Before we got into position our combat engineer would sweep the area around our spot to ensure there were no IEDs. He started at the far left of the squad, working his way toward the road where I was with my team leader. It was late and I was tired of standing, so I went to get into position anyway. As I set my SAW down on this small berm, I heard my combat engineer shout (mind you we are supposed to be quiet for this operation) to \"hold the fuck on.\" he skipped the next three or so potions and came straight to mine. So I sigh, pick my saw up off it's bipods and he makes his first pass right over where my weapon was. *Beep* Whatever intuition he had stopped me from laying down on an IED big enough to dismantle a Humvee, let alone what it would have done to little old me. We ended up spending the rest of the night in a cordon around this sucker until EOD showed up and did a controlled detonation. I have other times where I was pretty lucky, but this one takes the cake. Edit: A word.",

Honestly it started to become weird how often that happened and how there isn't a explanation for it at all.

Now I've a great career, got married in a castle (in my home town) and have even started paying a mortgage (something else i was awful at was managing money and my credit score).

My whole family raced over within 10 mins (parents, brother, sister, cousin etc.) The paramedics told us later that they only kept going with the CPR because everyone was there blubbering away. 6. I was 10 mins by ambo away from one of, if not the best cardiac hospitals in the state. 7.

Everyone can get to the last block easily but it won't let you stack the last one, it will either come short or skip across. For some reason the gods blessed me that day and allowed me to win... On my first attempt... the first machine I laid my hands on. I chose the Star Wars 360 bundle and the hook started turning and then stopped. All the displays started flashing \"ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR\" and i was like welp that sucks.. a maintenance guy walks past and I flag him over. I explain to him the sitch and he obviously does not believe me. I'm just some dude that found and errored machine and lied about winning. He opens up the coin panel and hits some buttons that bring up the last game and he looks at it and says \"holy shit you actually did win\" then asks me which prize I selected. I tell him the 360, he pulls it out off the hook and hands it to me then directs me to the counter. They fill it with the actual console and send me packing. I took it home and after 2 days realise that I actually don't like consoles, sell it on eBay for $500, buy a Sapphire 7870 OC and laugh with my /r/pcmasterrace/ brethren Tldr: turned $1.25 into $500 ",

The empty trailer was absolutely mangled, our car just had a bent trailer hitch. Not only would they probably have died if they didn't have the trailer, it was also completely empty, and a rental. About as lucky as an accident can get. Insurance paid for the new hitch and the trailer. The single day they have a rented trailer, out of all the days this could have happened at. It's unbelievable.

It triggers based on pseudo-random chance which basically means if you keep missing the big hit, the chance of it triggering is raised. If you get the big hit twice in a row, the chance is diminished heavily. One time I hit the ultimate like 7-8 times in a row on a guy and killed him when I was technically supposed to lose the fight and die.

All I had was my mountaineers ax, no crampons, ropes, or safety. My buddy was a stronger climber than me, and went for it. I could have turned around, or gone up. It didn't seem to difficult to climb up (2 stories, or so I thought) so I went for it . I got to a point where my ax was on a hold above my right hand, half a meter, and my left hand was on a hold and so were both my feet. Well, the rock was sandstone, and my left hand breaks off a peice of the wall, my left and then right foot slip. The only thing saving me was my ax tip. I was hanging for a second, and lucky I found other holds to climb. That would have been horrible to fall. I would have been broken or dead otherwise. I got to the top, but I haven't been Alpine climbing since then. Very luck to be alive. ",

I rolled off, the atv hit the other side of the rut and came straight down on me. An atv doesn't sound that heavy, but under water and in deep mud, you can't seem to find the traction to lift. I remember putting my hand up hoping it would reach out of the water for my cousin to at least know where I was. Luckily he's a big man and flung the atv off me and scooped me or I likely would have drowned in waist deep mud. Even further, the atv landed on my head and cracked my helmet. Earlier that day, we were pulling out of the driveway with just hats on and my dad ran out with my helmet and made me wear it.

Nothing was leaving O'hare, and when they finally cancelled my flight, I had no choice but to get in line with hundreds of other people to reschedule. When I got to the front of the line, I saw how nasty people were being to the poor agents, so when it was my turn, I greeted the agent politely and told her I wasn't in a hurry to get home, and I'd take any available seat that she could book me on, I just didn't want to fly standby. At the time, I didn't realize I wasn't getting my checked luggage back. So when I arrived at the airport a few days later, I was still wearing the same clothes, I certainly wasn't looking my best. As I was checking in, the agent asked me if I'd booked a first class seat. I gave her a look and asked rather rudely \"do I look like I booked a first class seat?\" She laughed off my sarcasm and told me I was booked through to Seattle in first class and recommended that I enjoy myself. I did. Except the asshole next to me took the last steak.",

I failed. Miserably. Didn't have a clue. Two weeks later they told me I was third choice (after the two apprentices they chose) and they liked all I had to offer but they wished I had more knowledge on the catalyst process. I wasn't too bothered as I had, by this point, accepting a position at a good company but appreciated the feedback. Turns out I knew one of the lads who got the first job instead of me. His uncle worked there. His uncle had told him to swot up on catalyst converters as the company had a habit of asking about them in interviews.

She was beautiful, well, she was hot, really, in that hot librarian /serious girl sort of way. But I am a lunatic, and I knew in my heart she would never date me, so I never asked her out. I moved to Europe, and then plan to move to the West Coast. I came back for my grandma's 101st birthday, and was staying in my home town for a few days. I had to buy a Christmas gift, and there is a massive Walmart not far from where my parents live. I went in three times, ran into people I knew from high school each time, and each time forgot what I was there to get and got something different. On my fourth trip into the store, this hot girl made a wrong turn and got diverted into the parking lot, where she spotted me from very distant vantage point. She drove to this massive store, came in, and found me in the toy section, holding a plastic XWing that I was buying for my brother in law. It was the gift that I had gone there to get in the first place. She turned the corner of the aisle, and I was so excited to see her I kept dropping everything I took off the rack while we were talking. Paintbrushes, those little bottles of paint you use for models. I would grab something, and drop it, while babbling like an uncoordinated idiot. We talked outside after I made my purchase, and she cried a little. She had just broken up with her boyfriend of several years, primarily because he had a problem with alcohol, but also because he cheated on her. I knew that, again, I could not ask her out. She was far too vulnerable, and I would look like a bottom feeder. A month passed, and I did not see or speak to her. My departure time was approaching: I was moving to California. But I know that life is short, so I wrote her a short poem about the conversation we had. I sent it to her, and asked her if she would like to come to a New Year's party with me. She said yes, but only as friends. We dated two years long distance, she moved to Los Angeles where we were engaged for two years, we have been married for seven years, and have two boys whose only negative impact has been that they do not seem to know that sleep is to occur during the nighttime hours. Had my wife not spotted me from that great distance, and decided to come find me in that massive Walmart, I would still be the forever alone/fedora neckbeard poster boy. Life can be so unabashedly boring. Then, in one moment, everything turns on a dime, and changes forever. Sometimes, I wonder if I got hit by a car on my last trip into that store, and this whole thing has been some sort of coma dream. Because honestly, I'm just not this lucky. ",

One did, directly into my hands and some bitch behind me snatched it out of my lap. Like homegirl had to stand up and lean over me to get it. I turned around to confront her but she was with a group of friends and they all ganged up on me. I wasn't about to get my ass kicked over a glow stick, but I'm still mad about that. It's been probably 15 years. Edit: thanks for the gold. Your money is probably worth more than that glow stick was. ",

They had the Cubs logo on the aide and being 8 years old, I couldn't wait to bring these to school. I was wearing them on top of my head as the crowds of people pushed to get to their seats.

                    "body": "Here's a copy paste of my \"rules:\" Tips for those new to sweeping: 1. Always use your REAL information. Do not use nicknames, fake phone numbers or e-mail addresses. Remember, the sponsors need to contact you if you win and if you supply fake info, they won't be able to do so! Using your real name is important for claiming bigger prizes. Due to legal issues, your legal name must be used. 2. Don't expect constant wins, especially at first. When you first start, you likely will not win anything for quite some time (months). I will have spells of months were I don't win anything at all myself. The wins will eventually start to roll in if you put enough time into it! 3. This is a hobby, not a job. You will not make enough off of this to make it a full time job. 4. Only enter contests you're interested in and can afford the taxes on. Trust me, it sucks getting stuck with a prize that you can't sell and have no use for. It would also suck to win a $50,000 car, but not be able to claim it as you can\u2019t come up with the $12,000 tax withholding. 5. Follow all sweepstakes rules! If there are certain restrictions that you don\u2019t meet, winning will get you nothing. Common rules are restricted by location, to those who are engaged, to new parents, limited to tobacco users, and of course entry limits. If a contest is single entry, do not create multiple email addresses to get around it as it will get you disqualified. One entry is better than zero and a potential ban from all future sweepstakes. (on this note - I will only be sending out contests that are United States eligible. If something is questionable, I will point it out) 6. Any contest that makes you pay to enter it is a scam (with the exception of local raffles). Don't do it. 7. HAVE FUN! There's nothing like the thrill of a win, no matter how minor it is. And when the big one comes through - such a RUSH! Don't get mad or sad or upset if you're not winning, your time will come. The following are strongly suggested, but not \"rules\" per se: 8. Don't feel obliged to sign up for newsletters. If signing up for a newsletter is optional, I strongly suggest you don't sign up for it. 9. Do not write off a contest because it has a photo or essay entry requirement. Often many people skip over these sweeps because of the work which causes the entry pool to be significantly smaller. These are generally your best chance to win! 10. Same goes for instant win - play them! 11. Create bookmark folders! Here is a screenshot of my sweeps folder: http://i.imgur.com/vD1JQlH.png I have one parent folder and under that is multiple date folders. The dates represent the date the contest ends, and I only put daily entry contests in there. Each day, I go through and right click the date folder and select \"open all bookmarks\" to make entering each one every day a breeze! 12. Use your browsers auto-fill feature or an add-on such as Roboform. I'm not going to list all add-ons for each browser, but a Google search of 'browser name form fill' should help! 13. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED! Create accounts solely for entering sweepstakes. I have a separate e-mail address, facebook, instagram, pintrest, twitter, tumblr, snapchat, twitch, youtube, etc account solely for contests. It is also important to make your fake accounts appear real by posting a few random \"real\" posts every now and then (for twitter you can pin to the top). Some of the social contest hosts (gleam, woobox) can get really annoying to your family and friends, hence why I suggest creating separate accounts. At the very least, create a separate e-mail address as the spam can get overwhelming at times. I suggest gmail as it has the best filtering out of all free hosts. Which leads me to: 14. Filtering! I get easily 400+ emails a day, so set up e-mail filters to make managing your e-mails easier. I have the following filters applied: http://i.imgur.com/9mslOt9.png This makes any e-mail that comes in with those words identified automatically get starred, marked important, and applies a custom label I created called \"WINS.\" I mark near everything as spam, so my spam folder gets quite full. Filtering makes scrolling through the junk mail easier. A potential win stands out quickly. This will cause a lot of false positives, but a false positive is better than a missed win! Please note that my list is not perfect and still may miss some wins, so be careful! 15. If you're super organized, you can keep a spreadsheet of contests entered, date ending, and sponsor. That way you can unsubscribe from certain sponsors e-mails after the contest ends. 16. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED! Add your phone number to the national Do Not Call registry. This will help phase off spammy calls. https://donotcall.gov/ To stop pre-screen mailings, register yourself at https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t HAVE FUN! Start by finding new sweeps on the slickdeals.net contests and sweepstakes forums, Twitter searches, /r/sweepstakes and /r/giveaways (though those two subreddits are referral links, meaning you're helping others and \"reducing\" your odds) or any of the hundreds of sweepstakes listing sites (some are better than others). Ask any questions, I've been doing this for awhile. ",

He feels turbulence rock his ship in ways he didn't expect. The laughter stops, the controls held in white knuckled hands. He knows that everyone he went to highschool with is in there. He knows them all, he's seen their families. This group of passengers is *not* like all the others. He notices his forehead coated in sweat. His confidence wavers. He pulls back too fast, and the plane only begins to spin in it's freefall. The sudden change in air pressure shatters the wings off the base of the plane, and the pilot feels it as if his own arms were torn at the root. He experiences a moment of existential terror in which the full sound of the screaming throughout the cabin diffused through the door into his soul. Despite knowing his wife and children will miss him, and likely lose their home without him, he feels a strange calm. The screaming becomes a quiet reverie in the distant background, like the dull roar of a popular restaurant. He stares with an almost tranquil numbness out the window, at the mountainous terrain spinning around him 20,000 feet below. 16,000 feet. 14,000. His moment of satisfaction, turned to ashes in a dumb and overconfident mouth, became now a quiet descent to an instant grave. To the pilot, the moment seemed a thing of beauty, until shattered by the cabin door being smashed open. The pilot turned to see his most experienced & best-trained stewardess in the doorway, hair disheveled, face stained in a mess of tears and mascara. Behind her the screaming, nude, raw, in the flesh. Behind her he saw the faces. He saw his friends, their families and they saw him. The screaming was worse than fire. Knowing his aptitude as a pilot, the stewardess was suspicious of pilot error and roared one word, hysterical, choked with the rage & fear of one murdered; \"Why?\" He was quiet a moment. And then he said, \"For the lulz.\"",

                    "body": "I recently took a CPR class, so I found out about all the bullshit about CPR that's out there thanks to Hollywood. **If you perform CPR on someone, they will eventually inhale sharply and come back to life, bewildered but ok.** There is a 0.25% chance of a dead body (and yes, every body in need of CPR is a dead body) being revived by CPR. The purpose of CPR is not to revive someone. The purpose of CPR is to keep the vital organs: heart, lungs, and brain, alive and as undamaged as possible until either the paramedics can get there with a Defib, or if that fails, preserve the organs for donation. If you don't perform CPR and just wait for the Defib, the brain will start to die, and if that happens, even if you can save the person at that point, they could very well have permanent brain damage for the rest of their life. All CPR does is preserve organs. **Defibrillators will get a flatlined heart beating again**. So, when the heart is in distress, it can do one of three things. It will A) pump so fast that you can't even feel a pulse because there's no time for the pressure in the blood vessels to drop off, B) just kind of 'quiver', or C) completely stop. A defibrillator can often revive a patient in cases A), and B), but most likely not in case C). A common misconception is that defibrillators get stopped hearts started again. They actually do the opposite: they *stop* hearts that aren't beating correctly. They stop the heart so it can sync up with the signals from the brain stem and beat normally again. Defibs are a \"reset\" button, not a \"start\" button. A fully flatlined heart in a hospital has, at most, a 2% chance of being revived. And that's in Sweden, the best case scenario. In the U.S. it's 1%. Again, in a hospital, surrounded by the best equipment and most trained people. **You can just lightly do a bent-arm chest compression like they did on Baywatch**. The heart is behind this thing called a ribcage. The ribcage, as it turns out, is not very flexible. When you're performing CPR on an adult, you need to compress the chest 2 inches or more in order to properly massage the heart. So, naturally, when you perform CPR on someone, you are probably going to break their ribs, their breastbone, or a combination. It is going to give you the willies. But, keep in mind, if this person needs CPR, they are dead. This is a dead body you're working with. They're not going to feel their ribs breaking, and broken bones are the least of their worries. Don't worry about hurting them or moving them. They are dead, you can't hurt them, and their breathing and heart beat are the number one priorities. Even if they have a hacked-off limb, still do chest compressions. Most of the blood you're pumping won't go to the extremities anyway. Don't worry about pumping all the blood out of someone. It doesn't work that way. **You don't have to do mouth-to-mouth anymore**. (edited) So, I previously said this is untrue, but it turns out to be one of those things where there's some nuance. As of 2015, the American Heart Association does not recommend interrupting chest compressions for ventilation, but *only during the first few minutes after the witnessed cardiac arrest.* There is already oxygen in the blood stream so the priority is getting the oxygen that's already there to the heart, lungs, and brain. However, after the first few minutes, you need to start ventilating. This is kind of a tricky thing to determine and I personally don't agree with this guideline because it muddies the waters in the decision-making process and doesn't fit every situation. For one, it can be easily interpreted to mean from the beginning of CPR, but it's actually from the beginning *of the witnessed cardiac arrest*. What if you didn't witness the cardiac arrest? What if you walked around a corner and saw the person on the ground? You have *no* idea how long they've been there. This is why I don't like the AHA's new guideline. It introduces a complexity into the decision-making tree and it only applies in limited situations. Now, you have to do one type of CPR for one situation and another type of CPR for other situations; and then in some situations you start with one type and switch to another. If you discover a person in cardiac arrest and you didn't witness the beginning of the episode, you should definitely start ventilating after the first set of 30 compressions, period. You have no idea how long they've been there and when in doubt, it's better to breathe for them than not.",

The hair only becomes wider and feels coarser. This belief is due to hair which has never been cut having a tapered end, whereas after cutting the edge is blunt and therefore wider than the tapered ends; the cut hair appears to be thicker and feels coarser due to the sharper, unworn edges. The shorter hairs being \"harder\" (less flexible) than longer hairs also contributes to this effect.",

Then the internet came along, and if you Google 55 38 7 you'll see a bunch of sites, including Wikipedia, that debunk the myth. Trainers and presentation skills coaches love the myth because it seems to substantiate the point of view that movement and tone are critical to a presentation.

Of course, presentations are definitely improved by \u2022appropriate hand movements \u2022physical movement by the presenter \u2022great body language \u2022raising and lowering the tone of voice to emphasize points but those are not more important than the words.

Some are as high as 10-15%. 2) Compression only CPR is highly recommended if you don't have a bag valve mask or a pocket mask. Especially if it's a stranger. You don't know what they have, and I've performed CPR on plenty of folks who erupted with vomit and blood. Not a mouth-to-mouth situation. 3) CPR absolutely can bring someone back on its own. What you're referring to is a cardiac arrhythmia as the source of the problem. If respiratory arrest is the primary problem (with cardiac following shortly thereafter) then CPR can get blood moving again while the respiratory issue is fixed (choking, fluid overload, drowning, or other kind of obstruction). A good example of this is the imminently coding infant/toddler. The vast majority of pediatric codes are respiratory related. CPR isn't started at cardiac arrest, it's started when the heart is beating less than 60 bpm until the breathing is fixed. No AED shock or advanced medicine necessarily required. 4) They're dead, yes, but improper CPR can absolutely ruin what could otherwise be a success. Pushing as hard as you possibly can could cause irreversible blunt trauma to the heart muscle. Unnecessarily breaking the ribs (sternum cartilage excluded) can puncture a lung resulting in blood, air, or both filling the chest cavity (hence the blood from the mouth I mentioned). Providing too many \"breaths\" or with too much volume increases chest cavity pressure, drastically lowering cardiac output. Overall your points are very strong and you're a good person for learning! More should learn, and the Hollywood myths need to go away. Please don't take any of this as criticism - most of it isn't taught in CPR classes, but in advanced/pediatric cardiovascular life support. There's likely science behind some ideas that have been half-explained to me, too. ",

Breakfast also makes a large contribution to daily micronutrient intake (Balvin Frantzen et al., 2013). Iron, B vitamins (folate, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12) and Vitamin D are approximately 20\u201360% higher in children who regularly eat breakfast compared with breakfast skippers (Gibson, 2003). Consuming breakfast can also contribute to maintaining a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range. Two systematic reviews report that children and adolescents who habitually consume breakfast [including ready-to-eat-cereal (RTEC)] have reduced likelihood of being overweight (Szajewska and Ruszczynski, 2010; de la Hunty et al., 2013). Breakfast consumption is also associated with other healthy lifestyle factors. Children who do not consume breakfast are more likely to be less physically active and have a lower cardio respiratory fitness level (Sandercock et al., 2010). Moreover, there is evidence that breakfast positively affects learning in children in terms of behavior, cognitive, and school performance (Hoyland et al., 2009).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737458/) Where the quote comes from doesn't make it any less true.

We have a law called the \"Government in the Sunshine Act\", which is a pretty good thing as far as transparency goes. It basically lets the public and the media have access to pretty much any government document. That includes arrest records. So while in other states, the police can withhold certain information and newspapers have to go through certain channels to get the weird and wacky stories, papers here can just call up the precinct and sift through records until they find something. This, plus the fact that we do have alligators and meth and a *lot* of people, makes us seem like some super ridiculous alternate universe, but comparing our news to other states is comparing our dirty laundry to their clean.

As someone with a chronic health disorder, my experience with HR is that they are people who try to find a way around disability law in as many ways as they can, or people who make it as difficult as possible for me to adapt so that they can sack me. The guys on my side are usually occupational health (and more often than not my *actual manager*), who are the ones trying to keep me in a job. When you get big organisations and people don't actually know each other, it often ends up the HR see people as commodities, and line managers see people in a more nuanced way - \"yes, they've had a lot of sick leave this year, but they also did x, y and z under budget and before deadline and I don't want to lose them\" - so my experience has been that managers are trying to get HR to look beyond the numbers, while HR have a stick floating above their head because they have a target of reducing organisational sick leave this year.",

Your hindbrain (the medulla, the cerebellum, etc.), your midbrain (VTA, etc.), and certain parts of your forebrain (thalamus, the entirety of the ptuitary system controlled by the hypothalamus) are responsible for unconscious functioning and regulation of bodily processes, but every time you're thinking at all you're using your frontal and prefrontal cortexes, whenever you're looking at anything you're using your occipital lobe, whenever you experience any kind of sensation related to touch or sound you're using your parietal and temporal lobes, respectively, or whenever you're trying to retrieve something from or encode something to your long term memory you're using your association areas and hippocampus. We consciously use at least 1/2-3/4 of our brain at any one time, but like you said if we used the entirety of it we wouldn't be any smarter, we'd probably be less so because we'd have to devote conscious effort to breathe or pump blood and therefore wouldn't be able to devote as much energy towards higher order functioning.

Then, after it was completed, he treated Golden Globes voters to a lavish Vegas getaway as a quid pro quo for their support of Zadora's candidacy, even though the movie hadn't actually been commercially released in the US at that point. Zadora won the Golden Globe for \"Best Female Newcomer\"... beating out, among others, Kathleen Turner in \"Body Heat\".

Blame it on Instagram. Since the early 2010s, fashion has been forced to start catering to popular opinion to a greater extent, and social media makes popularity easily quantifiable. As a result, girls are today asked at castings about their follower counts across various platforms; their worth as models, to put it crudely, relies no longer solely on the work they perform and how well their looks align with industry standards, but also on their general popularity. See #DGMillenials for the most recent event in this tradition. Gigi, Bella and Kendall are all part of the new generation of models who use their social media appearance to leverage careers in fashion. An even better example would be Alexis Ren. Now, you may or may not be fan of the girls--Gigi was put under scrutiny for her poor walking--and the tendency to value Insta-fame over actual performance definitely has drawbacks. One aspect worth pointing out, however, is how this new trend has renewed the relevance of the individual model. In the post-supermodel era, fashion became increasingly defined by a mentality in which models were considered interchangeable and disposable. Today, only Gigi can be Gigi.",

Basically, it should have never had a sequel but who cares -- money. Lots of times those sequels are trash especially if the first is fun to hate-watch. As far as comedies go, there's a lot of shitty ones that get forgotten but the first mall cop isn't one of them. Remembering this movie to watch with my kids in the future will be phenomenal. Try to get a copy on DVD and just set it away for a decade or so and then stumble across it randomly. Maybe I am wrong but I just love this fucking movie. And to be honest, I've seen it around 10 times alone. Laughing alone at something so dumb is just great. Lovable Kevin James in a crime-action comedy? C'mon, that's a stretch. Obviously I am not saying it should be world renowned but it really is funny. Put it on the tv at night and get some work done, I'll probably do it tonight for that matter. ",

Yes I know I can take adult classes. Reasons being why I never learned how to swim is as followed: * Fell into the deep end of a pool at a young age * Slowly grew out out of the fear due to my best friend, the life vest! * I have anxiety and rarely can relax on land, let alone in water. * I've actually been jet skiing, tubing, and snorkeling all with my best friend. Didn't want to take away from my wife on our honeymoon, so I sucked it up and went snorkeling, and because my motor functions in water is piss poor, I was about 40 yards behind the whole group and the tour guide practically dragged me to shore. * I do appreciate the kind words and dickhead comments. They make me smile and laugh. If I had time or cared enough I would take classes. The only reason I would take a class would to scare the shit out of my wife and \"fall\" into a pool. It doesn't bother me that I can't swim, but I always tell people I will ultimately die in a drowning accident. * Fuck sharks.",

No one really had any idea what CF actually was before he was diagnosed. Learning about it and finding out what he has to live with the rest of his life was rough. Anyways since then we have thrown a philanthropy event every year in the spring to raise money and awareness in the hopes to remove some of the stigma from the diesease. 100% of the proceeds go to the CF foundation. Hope everything works out man. Here is a link if anyone would like to donate it would help a lot. https://www.tautug.com/",

When the pain was so unbearable that I went to the ER they thought it was a kidney stone. It took a team of doctors and a specialist to figure out that it was epididymitis, swelling in the vas deferens in the testicles. They originally couldn't figure it out because the \"primary cause\" of epididymitis is chlamidia, and my STD panels were clean. The reality is that it can be caused by any type of bacteria, and the abdominal pain was some sort of \"residual pain,\" that is, pain felt in a body part next to the primarily affected area.

He served probation for assaulting me but the whole church community supported him because they \"forgave\" him and he wanted to work on the marriage and I wanted to leave him.

Turn any movie or book into a \u201cplot riddle\u201d by presenting the ending, without all the details leading up to it \u2013 people have to guess how it all happened (and thus will work through the plot). For example, \u201ca barefooted man throws his jewelry in a fire. Why?\u201d and answer with the plot of the Lord of the Rings. (Alternatively, for a fun semi-riddle, simply tell a a major plotline as though it happened in your own life. See how long it takes for people to catch on. For example, using Lord of the Rings again, you could start\u2026\u201cMy uncle always had a quirky friend [Gandalf], and one day he told me I had to get a watch [the ring] across town [\u201cto Mordor\u201d]. So I started, but found myself pursued by this dude in a black car with tinted windows [ringwraith].\u201d See how far ridiculous it gets before people catch on! Soon you won't have any friends, and no one will want riddles - but it is jolly good the first time. For those who want my favorite semi-quick \"true riddle:\" >A wise queen is seeking wise advisors, and has a test for the three wisest she can fine. She puts a hat on each of their heads \u2013 they can see the color of the hat on the other two heads, but not their own. She says \u201cthere are both blue and white hats, and I have put out at least one blue hat.\u201d The first person to figure out the color of their own hat will be declared the wisest. Who and how? For those looking, again, for an alternative (and more frustrating) good time that will end in a loss of friendship, you can easily simulate the above riddle with three friends, two markers, and well-applied marks on the forehead. EDIT: This has come up in a few answers - blue and white hats exist (i.e. imagine she is pulling the hats out of a box where there are only blue and white hats). But she is only a guaranteeing that there is one blue hat. There is no guarantee that there is a white hat. As some folks have noted, there are some scenarios in which determining one's own hat color is very easy. If that is the scenario, it is hardly a good test of wisdom, and that is therefore probably not what happened. Unless our queen actually isn't wise at all, in which case the whole thing is moot. ",

The half dime (or half disme) is exactly what it sounds like: a coin half the size, weight, and value of a dime. This was when coins were struck out of silver so the mass ratios were important. The half dime struggled as a coin, as it is incredibly small and was subjected to a lot of wear. It was replaced with a larger 5 cent piece made of nickel. To distinguish this coin from the silver half dime it was called a nickel, a name that exists to today. It has had that composition essentially unchanged since the denomination's introduction, with the exception of during world war 2 when they were struck out of a silver alloy. Another option would be two 3 cent coins, minted out of silver from the 1850s to 1870s. It never really caught on as a denomination but is still legal US currency. Or just a nickel and a penny if you want to be boring. ",

The next day, no one has left, meaning there are more than one person with blue eyes.

Since the other two don't have blue eyes, those two will instantly know that they have blue eyes. Once the two blue eyes people are gone, the brown eyes will know that they have brown eyes.

However the next day rolls around and Bob is still there, meaning he couldn't conclude what color his eyes were. Now Alice knows she has blue eyes, and leaves on the second night. Bob has been thinking the same things as Alice and leaves as well. Again with three people. Each observes that the other two have blue eyes. If s/he had not-blue eyes, the other two would make like Alice and Bob and leave on the second night. But when everyone's there on the third day, they each realize the other two had still been unsure. So they all leave on the third night.

He would immediately know he had the only blue hat and can blurt out the answer. This satisfies the conditions set out in the riddle, but it doesn't require much wisdom, so let's move on. 2. The blue hat guys see 1 blue, 1 white just like the white hats from scenario 1. They know that if they have a white hat, it means the blue hat they see will quickly deduce they are the only blue hat and answer. If he says nothing for long enough, then it's probably because he also sees one of each and then they can safely answer \"blue.\" For those guys timing is key. Make sure you wait long enough for the other guy to not be the 1 blue hat guy from scenario 1, but not too long that he beats you to the punch. The guy with the white hat sees 2 blue, and has to decide if he's in scenario 2 or 3. There isn't really a good way to do this. 3. This is the fairest scenario, as all three are on equal ground. If you see 2 blue hats you might want to just go for it and say blue since it would be fairest, but you run the risk of being white hat from scenario 2. If you decide to wait it out then you need to wait long enough for the blue hats from scenario 2 to have had their time to speak, but that's really imprecise. You might want to just immediately say \"white\" for the chance that you are in scenario 2 and can beat out the 2 blue hats who are waiting. There is wisdom in acting quickly if it can seize you an advantage, after all. Of course, all three of those scenarios assume they wise men can only use the information given from the queen and what they can see on each other's heads. If we remove those assumptions then the wisest might be the first person to look in a mirror, or the first to ask someone he trusts, \"What color is my hat?\" Heck, the queen didn't make any rules about being unable to remove your hat, so perhaps it's the first one to take off their own hat and see for themselves.",

Imagine being so desperate to end your life that you jump to your death from a building with a man you love, only to be saved by the parachute he set up for you.

Moments later her parachute opens unexpectedly and she glide safely to the ground while watching the love of her life plummet to his death. She lands on the ground in shock. She can't quite grasp the horror of what just happened so she search her pockets for her phone to call somebody, anybody. In her pocket there's a note which reads from the man she just jumped with: \"Babe, you're he love of my life. I can't stand the though of you being dead, so I properly packed your parachute for you. I hope you can live for the both of us. I love you forever.\" Years go by, she's depressed and suicidal, but she's too scared to kill herself. She's all alone in the world with nobody to care for her. She lives like this for another 50 years until she finally dies of a weak heart that's slowly been reducing her quality of life for years.",

It makes it more obvious, yes, but the \"no eyes\" way makes the trick ignoring the way English grammar works. A man with one eye is not a man with no eyes. The taking plums part actually works grammatically. But the \"no eyes\" doesn't. Alternatively, I think you can say, \"A man who doesn't have eyes.\" I think it's specifically the \"no\" that implies not a single one and thus messes up the riddle.",
