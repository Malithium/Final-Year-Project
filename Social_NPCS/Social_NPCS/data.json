Blake liked to jump on Davis' back, and Davis would always swing him off in a playful way. One day, Blake jumped on Davis' back as usual and latched on. Davis snapped. He **screamed** \"BLAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!!\" as he grabbed Blake by his hands and aggressively *flipped* him over his head and slammed him onto the pavement. Blake was stunned, and his attempt to stand back up was fruitless as Davis began to repeatedly and ruthlessly kick Blake while he was down. We all just watched. We were in shock. We didn't help, we just watched. Eventually, a teacher stopped the beating. Davis got suspended, and Blake (somehow) ended up being okay. They were friends again the next week. ",

Strung out all the time and kinda bad in school, but not mentally ill - just had a shit home life, and it made him look like a druggie from lack of sleep and (I suspect in hindsight) regular meals. He was quiet, usually polite, but really didn't have any friends that I can remember. There was this little group of middle schoolers that just picked on this guy all the time. Spread rumors about his family behind his back, 'accidentally' bumped shoulders with him in the hallway to make his books scatter, 'accidentally' spilling drinks during lunch to get on his clothes, and countless other things to inconvenience this kid and humiliate him. I can't remember if they had a reason, and people reported them to teachers a couple times, but they always insisted it was all accidental, and the kid just had bad luck. They got detention at worst. Most evidence was circumstantial. Skinny kid didn't act out towards them, didn't defend himself, just kept his head down and trodded on. One day (his locker was a few doors down from mine) he had dropped a pencil. I happened to pick it up, and hand it back to him. He gave me a smile, and tucked it into his pocket. \"Watch this,\" He said, in that quiet, barely-there voice of his. The little assholes were coming back down the hallway. I'd seen it happen enough that I could already tell they were aiming for a body-check. Something about the way they focused on him while they walked, and kinda drifted sideways to be in the center of the hall instead of one side or the other. He had his books in one hand, and the other hand in his pocket as he started walking down the hallway toward the group. Right as the ringleader pushed to the side to shoulder-check him, he whipped his hand up and lunged into the other guy. The pencil stabbed right into the other guy's shoulder, pushed by the momentum of both of their bodies. Bully dropped like a rock, shrieking, pencil sticking out of his shoulder - just under his collar bone. I remember thinking it was unlucky he had decided to wear such a wide collar - the pencil missed cloth entirely. (I was also thinking 'holy shit i'm so glad I was nice to him just now') Skinny kid just kept walking down the hall. Skinny kid was expelled. After that day, I never saw him again. We weren't really friends, but I hope his life turned out okay =\\ ",

Windows, lights, the whole work. Once he was finished, he fished out his briefcase from the now-ruined car, ripped off the license plate from the car, then casually/calmly walked to work (we think).

The second one was a different ex housemate thought he was being spied on, and I came home right after he destroyed the living room. He had flipped the coffee table breaking all of the dishes (luckily he missed the TV), punched 2 holes in the windows on the door and threw over one of our plastic rolly shelves, then later in the night literally ripped his doorknob from his door and replaced it with a dead bolt refusing to speak to me or my fiancee, and then insisted on having a cop present before saying anything to us. Scariest snap I've ever witnessed, and very creepy because this guy felt he was in danger, of what I'm not sure, and there was nothing posing a danger to him, and the fact he felt that way in the house made me think I was in danger, and him not explaining anything made it that much worse. That guy needs help and I hope he found it. Guy, if you're reading this, I hope Florida has been much better to you and your mind is in a better place. Also I still need your car title to get it out of my fiances parents yard. ",

I peak in there and, what do I find other than a piece of halibut At this point, as gently as I can, I tell her \"ma'am I'm happy to grab you another piece of fish, but it's only going to look like the one you've got right here, because this is indeed a piece of-\" At this point she cuts me off and starts screaming at me, \"DONT TELL ME THATS A PIECE OF FISH! IF YOU TELL ME THATS A PIECE OF FISH IM GONNA BE SO MAD ILL SPIT IN YOUR FACE!\" This lady was old and disheveled looking so I decided to take her at her word and retreat from the situation as quickly as possible. Grabbed her another piece of fish and told her sweetly that I hoped her day \"continued to be as wonderful as it had clearly been\", flagged down a manager who followed her around the store to make sure she didn't break/ steal shit as she proceeded to walk through the store ranting loudly and profanely about how nobody respects her and how she wanted to spit in my face.

So I'm at this wedding and the two Hispanic families are fairly large, and booze is freely flowing. For the most part the they were loud but there wasn't any trouble. The rest of the reception goes off without much issue aside from me observing the crowd and I see a guy that looked quite discontent at reception I figured he wasn't too social. I thought it would mostly be uneventful, well I was wrong as when the time came for the best man to give a speech, I saw the guy from earlier come up from his table, he must've been no older than 23 or so and he looked determined and angry. The Bride looks at this guy as she's quite anxious as to what he'll say, this young guy interrupts the best man by taking the mic. He paused for a moment and wipes his eye, I'm thinking great another emotional speech by a drunk guest. But alas nope, it was far better. It turns out the guy is a really close friend of the bride and professes his love for her and that the pregnant bride's child is his. The bride looks mortified and his emotional speech turns from a drunken profession of love to straight up anger and resentment, he then insults the Groom and the Grooms family. The father of the bride, the Groom, and Groom's friends are absolutely livid and ready to beat the living hell out of the guy, but I'll have to hand it to the guy as he was smart and he had brought his friends and it looked like the damn royal rumble as the men are just brawling chairs are being thrown. The Bride is leaving sobbing her friends and family in tow. It's just sea of people before the other family members and a few my fellow guards could even get there to even attempt to break up the fight, By then the cops were already there, quite a few people were arrested, the venue was pretty much trashed. **TL;DR: A close friend of the bride professes his love for her, big fight ensues, resulting in a ruined wedding and people were arrested** ",

But then he started talking about the whole country and the government being after him. That's when I realised there was obviously something wrong. And it just got worse and worse. I called his mum and girlfriend and they showed up within a half hour. We called the hospital and he ended up being committed in a closed ward for about two weeks.

For two weeks my niece would get off the bus crying, but didn't want to tell me what was going on. Her brother finally explained that a group of several bullies had been ganging up on them, but especially her since she was younger and smaller. He ended up with some pretty serious bruises standing up for her, but he's a skinny, lanky fellow so nobody really took him seriously. I called the bus driver and explained that if those kids came home with marks or tears one more time, I was going to be on that bus and we were going to have some serious issues. The very next day, I was standing at the road waiting. As soon as the bus stopped, I heard all hell break loose in the back. My niece had enough, grabbed a much larger, much older guy and put his head through the glass of a rear window. The driver was yelling, I was yelling for her to open the damn door, the kids were all shouting, and my niece had this dude on the floor, beating him in the face with a text book. I finally got on the bus to find my nephew standing there in shock watching his baby sister beat this guy to a pulp. I bear hugged her (a sight to behold, I'm sure, since she's a good bit taller than me and I was pregnant) and dragged her backwards off the bus. Told my nephew to grab her bag, told the bus driver that they had my number on file to discuss it later, and told the kid to be very certain who he fucked with from now on. Nothing ever came of it, but you can bet your ass nobody picks on those kids anymore. ",

A little background, this was not the ideal living arrangement. It was on the border of a not so great area, the conditions of the house were pretty grody, and there was a fair amount of drug use that happened there. Also should mention that Steve and his girlfriend fought a lot, some fights turning somewhat violent. On the eve of Thanksgiving Steve came home late at night and was in the middle of a phone call with his girlfriend, who presumably was trying to break up with him. There was lots of screaming that turned into sobbing that turned into begging. He locked himself in the bathroom and let out the most blood curling scream. Screaming and smashing and sobbing. Darren tried to talk to him through the door but he wouldn't have it. He continuously said things about how he wanted to die, how he was going to go to her house and kill himself in front of her. At this point someone had called his dad, the two were close, and asked him to come over to help because we didn't know how to handle the situation. There's a super loud crashing sound, like glass breaking. Steve busted the bathroom door open and ran past Darren, blood dripping down his face, bolted out the door and into the street with no shoes on, in the snow, screaming 'FIRST CAR I SEE' as if he's going to jump in front of it. We look in the bathroom and it's completely torn apart. The mirror is cracked from him punching it, there's blood in the sink and on the floor, everything is thrown about, and the back of the toilet is completely cracked in half. He BROKE THE TOILET WITH HIS FACE. Witnessing this was terrifying, watching the complete breakdown of a grown man, especially when I was still relatively young and had never seen anything like this before in my life. Darren went outside and tried to find where he went but he was long gone. His dad eventually found him sitting on his (ex)girlfriend's front porch, in the cold in the snow in the dark, just sitting there, not moving. He had run all the way there (it wasn't very close). She wasn't home, which was probably a very good thing. TLDR: My roommate's girlfriend broke up with him and he locked himself in the bathroom, had a complete mental breakdown, and broke the toilet with his face. ",

It must have been like 20 of us and it was a good mix of both boys and girls and we had an awesome time. One of our friends -- let's call him James -- was there for the sleepover, and we were all surprised because his parents were pretty strict and so he was never allowed to stay out late, let alone sleep over someone's house. But regardless, we were happy he made it out. Around 10pm, my mom calls me over and tells me that James' mom just called and asked if he was over our place. Apparently, he never told his parents about the sleepover since he knew they wouldn't let him join and so he decided to just come over without their permission. We were probably 11 or 12 at the time so disobeying parents was unheard of. So once his parents found out, James was forced to call his parents and for whatever dumb reason he decided to call them on speakerphone, in front of all of our friends. He asked his mom politely if he could stay, and told her that she was on speakerphone and so if she said no, everyone would know that she was being a \"bitch.\" This was absolutely stunning, as the idea of cursing at your parents was unheard of to me and most -- if not all -- of my friends. She was quiet for a second then immediately told him to take her off speaker. He then completely snapped, yelled from the of his lungs and said \"fuck you, you fucking bitch! I'm staying, and if you dare to try to come pick me up, I will fucking slap you!\" He said this maybe like 3 or 4 times while screaming and crying. Needless to say, the room got completely awkward. He hung up the phone and started screaming at us \"what are you looking at you dumb fucks?! you're just like my dumb bitch mom!\" I tried to tell him to calm down but he was entirely gone in his head. My dad had to come downstairs to tell him that his parents were at the door and that he should go talk to them. We all peaked out to listen to the conversation and see what would happen, and just as he promised, the moment his mom came to grab his arm to take him into her car, James slapped the living SHIT out of his mom, breaking her glasses and giving her a nosebleed. My dad ended up intervening; he grabbed James sternly by the arm, looked at him and told James that he will never do that again and that he's lucky he wasn't his son or else he'd kick the shit out of him (which was true; my dad was a Vietnam vet and was someone not to be messed with. He never beat us, but he sure did scare the shit out of me and all my friends). Anyway, James was taken home kicking and screaming and the rest of us could not wait until the following Monday to hear what happened. Unfortunately, he didn't show up to school; we found out from our teacher that James was no longer a student and that he had transferred to another school. We never heard from him or his family again. Not sure whatever happened to him, but I hope he and his family got some help. They obviously had some major emotional issues to deal with. ",

At one point we agreed that my cousins (who were 3 and 6 at the time) didn't need to see him in a casket so that wasn't there last memory of him. My mother comes out and she grabs on of them and starts trying to take them into the room with the casket. I had to grab my mothers arm and rip it off of them and damn near yell \"no\" at her to finally get her to stop. It was the first moment when I could really tell something was wrong. During the funeral the funeral service she acted like a small child who just want's to go home. Stomping her foot when somebody took to long or saying 'hurry up'. My Uncle looked her in the eye and had to tell her to stop. It was really bad and hard to watch. When we finally got home my dad put her to bed and she just sat there upright staring at the wall. The next morning my dad had to take her to the mental hospital because she just started throwing random things and was very unresponsive. The worst part is it was on my younger brother's birthday.",

I'm pissed because the casino is not a good place for my mother, but I tag along. Mom and aunt split their ways to play their choice of machines and I follow my mom. She gets one drink. Then another. \"No more,\" I tell mom when her glass is empty but she gets another. Then one more. She won't let me drag her out. My aunt finds us and is absolutely pissed that my mom is off her ass drunk. I am pissed at mom AND my aunt. My mom starts blubbering that we can't tell my dad, but my aunt still tells her we have to. As we ride home, my mom is sobbing uncontrollably and drunkenly throwing insults at me and my aunt. She has never, ever said, \"I hate your fucking guts!\" to me in my entire life, and it's not something I would ever, ever expect to hear her say, but she said it to me several times. I was breaking down. She starts going, \"I want to kill myself! I want to kill myself!\" My aunt instead drives us to the emergency room. I call my dad and he comes up. He's pissed and I'm pissed. My mom is put under observation and sedated because she's going absolutely nuts. She calms down, but gets carted from the psych ward to the recovery ward for the next couple of days. It was a nightmare. I never seen my mother like that. Following that was her confessing to a gambling problem and eventually revealing her compulsive lying. Although her behavior is several decades in the making, it all came to a head and manifested into a person I didn't recognize. That episode marked a time in my life where I realized I didn't really know my mom. However, the episode led to my dad realizing she is seriously ill. ",

He pushed me around like I was some worthless piece of shit, never acknowledged me, and did most of the things a 13 year old does with a 10 year old.

Before I continue let me just say, that my parents divorced when I was very young and I always feared that I was the reason it happened. This caused me a lot of problems later in life. So Bob just looked me in the eye with all his might and with the calmness of a Saint uttered a phrase that haunted my thoughts for a long time. \"You are the reason your parents seperated\". Followed by a smirk and him turning his back to me. It's true when they say you see red when very angry. The last thing I remember is seeing his bare back, but with a dark red filter over it. I went primal on his ass. Jumped at him and clawed away, it was a bloody mess with screams and shouts, my relatives rushed in, trying to pull me away. However, I wasn't finished yet. I bit his neck, sinking my teeth in. My uncle, bless him took the situation in his own hands and placed a firm punch on my face. Unfortunately... This caused me to rip his neck open.

Usually he would flip out over something stupid. When he had his minor freak outs it would involve cussing and throwing shit. One day we had a particularly stressful day on the job. It seemed like nothing we were doing was working out right and our plans for that days work had fallen apart. Sprinkle in a few rude customers and a few equipment break downs I knew that this guy was on the verge of breaking. Doomsday as we called it, had been free of his minor freak outs. We thought that maybe his therapy and meds were working but it turns out it was just the calm before the storm. One task we did required me and this angry guy to work on something together. The entire time he was talking to himself under his breath and was very short, like \"Give me that.\" or \"Do this\" just a few words at a time and in an angry voice. This wasn't uncommon from him so I didn't think much of it. I'm really not sure what was the straw that broke the camels back but whatever it was opened a flood gate. This guy was in the process of backing up one of our semi trucks when all the sudden he just slams on the breaks. All of us kind of stop and look at each other like \"Uh oh\" He climbs out and slams the door super hard. Then he kicks a pile of rocks next to him. He marches inside the warehouse and we heard him rummage around the tool cabinet and come back out with a wrench. He proceeds to beat the shit out of the tool box on the truck. Then he hops back in and continues to back the truck up. We though his outburst was over but ooohhhhh no that would have been too simple. After he go the truck backed up we were loading it. He just stood off to the side and watched while occasionally cussing about something or slamming his fist down on the table. All of us were walking on eggs shells trying not to set him off. The finally break came out of no where. He yelled, \"Fuck it\" and hopped in his pickup and drove off, spinning tires and flooring it. He was gone for no more than 10 minutes and came back like a bat out of hell. He hauled ass across our gravel parking lot to the back second warehouse. Me and my friend hoped on the golf cart and took off after him. We found him outside the second warehouse next to a troublesome piece of equipment. At a safe distance we watched as he used a cutting torch, sledge hammer, and other various tools to completely destroy this thing. Once it was down to a pile of scrap metal he loaded it up part by part into his pick up. He made sure to throw each piece as hard as he could. Sometimes he would burn his hand on a still hot chunk and he would cuss and walk around while holding his hand in his mouth. The boss had gotten word of what this dude was doing and came over to watch. After he had the metal loaded up he peeled out, in reverse this time, and was making a bee line for a small pond we had on our \"campus\". Once dangerously close he slammed on the breaks and all the scraps flew out the back into the pond. He got out to check his work and threw a few pieces that didn't make it into the water as far as he could. Seeming satisfied he peeled out again and made his way into the warehouse. As in he drove full speed through the large garage door and left black marks across the floor. We watched from the golf cart as people had to literally jump out of the way. Once back inside the warehouse he hopped on the fork lift and began loading empty pallets into the back of his pickup. Once his pickup was sagging from the weight he took off again. As he rounded a corner some of the pallets fell of and he got out. He punched and kicked them as he reloaded them by hand. Then he walked into the warehouse and took 6 ratchet straps and secured the fuck out of his load. Then he took off into the sunset. We all just kind of stood in shock for a bit trying to figure out what the fuck had just happened. The boss tried to call him but he wouldn't answer. After some time we all got back to work and sort of forgot about his freak out as we had a ton of work to do. When the day was wrapping up this guy was no where to be found and he still wouldn't answer his phone. Me and my friend took off to go look for him. It was a small town so we hit up the few bars and his house but couldn't find him. We went to our second location in town and he wasn't there but deep tire marks and the lack of pallets told us he had been there at some point. This location was unmanned unless we needed it so no one had been around to see if he was there. An idea struck us. Maybe he had gone to the landfill to throw away the pallets. We go there but the main gate was closed. A single employee remained. Since we went there a lot to toss out our own trash he recognized us. He said something to the effect of, \"Are you looking for that angry guy?\" we said yes and he let us in. We drove around the various pits looking for him. We eventually found him in one of the lone back pits. He was tearing apart each pallet nail by nail and throwing them into a pile of more pallets. We stood and watched for a bit and then he said in a really pissed off tone, \"Are you just going to stand and watch or are you going to help?\" so we grabbed what tools he had and we helped tear apart the last few pallets. After we were done he took off like a bat out of hell again. After that day he never mentioned it again and the boss sat him down for a long talk. The boss told him he needed to take a few days off and think long and hard if this job was for him. The boss also upped his allowance for health care under the condition he would use it for mental health care. As far as I know he enrolled in an intense angry management course and got on some stronger meds. He still had his minor freak outs from time to time but nothing like that. I haven't worked at that place in years but from what I hear he is doing much better. We still have no clue what caused him to snap and why on earth he decided to do the things he did. I will give props to the boss for not just firing him on the spot and giving him a second chance and giving him help. He was easily the most productive employee so that was probably a factor.",

It was bad too, he would apparently punch him in the shoulder when no one was looking, stole his lunch more than once, threw his $100 sunglasses into a clogged, disgusting toilet...just all kinds of stuff. This went on for two weeks and the guy just took it, never said anything. The very last day of camp, we're sitting at lunch and the bully happens to be sitting across the bullied. The bully wasn't even looking at or talking to the bullied kid, just sitting there eating his lunch, when out of nowhere the friendly kid leaps across the table and just starts pummeling the scrawny bully. Just beats the tar out of him before a few others could pull him off. It was only after that all the stuff came out; one person said 'I mean, I saw the scrawny kid punch him once but didn't think it was a big deal,' then someone else chimed in 'I saw the same thing the other day!'

My mother would usually leave my dad a wrapped plate of food, keeping it warm for him in the oven when he came home after working late. Well, it became obvious after a schedule change that he wasn't \"working late\" at all, and after my mother found out (it wasn't hard and she wasn't dumb), she left him an opened can of cream of mushroom soup, propped in a pot for him to heat up. A little benign when you find out your husband is cheating on you, but that's what she did. My father got home and immediately started yelling, \"What the *fuck* Ann!?\" and walked outside and hurled that open can of soup down the street, followed by our only pot. It cleared four houses' worth of length, I have never seen anything like it. He then took every other can of soup and proceeded to throw those too. And then all the canned vegetables. And then the plastic fruit cups we used for lunches. Finally, he launched the pickle jar, and that's when someone called the cops. Food scattered everywhere. I lived with my grandparents for a while. The other time was when I worked at the public library. This guy, Brett, had issues and a lot of medication that seemed to not agree with him sometimes? I'm not sure, but he talked about his bipolar disorder a lot. The thing is, he tried to order a lot of people around and he had no authority to do so. So when we would point out that we were working on other projects that our supervisor assigned us, he'd get so red in the face it was almost purple, hands shaking, tensing body. One time, he tells me to stop shelving the books I was assigned and start doing something else, real brusque-like. I was getting tired of him trying to order me around, so I told him no, I was going to finish what I started-- we were so behind in reshelving books, it was ridiculous. He wasn't in any way my supervisor, so that was that. Brett goes purple, real 0-100, and just screams out \"FUCK THIS,\" and shoves my cart over, spilling the books. I am terrified now, because holy shit. I grab on to the nearest pillar (I don't know why), and start calling out for help. He's kicking books everywhere and ranting loudly. The librarian at the time called security and I scampered down to the break room. I have no idea what happened, but after that, Brett didn't work there anymore. ",

Cool. We all took a road trip to the mountains of Vermont and were having a pretty fine time until dinner one evening. After we had finished eating, my dad and his friends were chatting around a table outside, while my cousin and I were sitting next to a little fire that was prepared, so we could all stay warm. Mind you, the husband of the couple we were staying with set up this fire about 5 feet from a massive woodpile he had stocked for winter (like a moron). My cousin and I were getting cold, so we added a couple logs onto the fire and were sitting happily, chatting in broken English and animated gesticulations when out of fucking nowhere, this long pony-tailed fucking hippie (my dad's friend) charges up to us and unleashes holy hell. He's screaming at the top of his lungs about how dangerous the fire is, and calling us morons for adding wood to it. His only \"gear shift\" was to stop yelling about what we did, and start asking us rhetorical questions like \"would you like it if I just set fire to your car? Or burned all of your shit down?\" Needless to say, my cousin and I were fucking stunned. We had no idea why he suddenly blew up at us at all. Later that evening, after my dad took his turn losing his shit at (his now ex-) friend for screaming at us like that. Once the shitstorm had subsided, my dad took the time to explain to us that when his two friends were very young, the had apparently hosted a party in their parents' house while they were out of town and accidentally burned it to the ground. **TL;DR: my dad's friend lost his shit at my cousin and I while we sitting at a fire because he thought it was too big, and reminded him of the time he burned his parents' house down.**",

They were **my** babies. The coworker was 18/19. I was not much older. We were the \"fun\" teachers that all the kids loved to be around simply because I always supplied the kids with creative and fun art projects. I poured in a lot of money so they would have a lot of fun. I would nicely correct my coworker on her behavior whenever she'd make stupid comments, \"oh if you misbehave Bob, i will make you work with only a group of girls!!\" yeah, no thats not going to fly with me. dont teach boys that working with girls sucks or is gross. None of us had proper childcare training, btw. One day i left the classroom for a few minutes to run an errand. I dont even remember what is was. Getting paper? idk. anyways at the time the class was getting ready to play outside by cleaning up the classroom. When i came back, all of the kids were sitting in a line against the wall near the door very quietly. One girl was crying off to the side. I was immediately alarmed. Why was she crying? I asked the coworker huffed, \"She wouldnt be quiet so shes not allowed to go outside\" I took the little girl outside into the hallway and sat her down. It took several tries to get her to talk to me. Other Counselor told all the kids to be quiet. One of the other kids wouldnt stop talking so the girl told them to be quiet. Immediately the teacher yelled at her, had her stand in front of the other kids and berated her in front of all of them. She humiliated the little girl in front of the whole class. I felt... a literal snap. I saw red. My face was hot. I swung into the room and calmly asked the teacher if what she described happened. she agreed. yes, she did. I raised my voice loudly. I berated her in front of the class. if you want to humiliate a child in front of their peers than i will do the same to you. I had never yelled like that in front of the kids. they had never seen me act the way i did. i told her to apologize to the girl. i told her that what she was wrong and how dare she. she apologized to the little girl. i told everyone to go outside to play. other counselor interrupted, \"except The Girl, shes staying inside for not listening!\" I whipped my head around and raised my voice again. She WILL be going outside to play, dont you even pull that bull with me. I made the coworker cry. she went to the corner of the playground and cried. I didnt give a fuck. that little girl loved me a lot more ever since that day. her mother came a few days later to thank me about defending her daughter and how she talked about me all the time and how she loved me.

He had greasy hair, he hung out with other kids at breakfast/lunch and discussed anime and video games in the early 2000's, he fixed people's computers for fun, played chess after school if he wasn't helping the librarians run the library. Butt of a LOT of bad jokes from people. He took it pretty stoically until someone one day slapped him while insulting him. It was like watching every bad thing this poor kid had endured come pouring out of the flood gates. He let out a loud, wordless scream and flung himself onto the other guy. Being that the other guy was a few inches shorter and half his weight, it was a given they were going down. Then the fat kid just began kneeing the other one in the groin while slamming his head into the floor. Teachers had to come and pull him off the other kid then it took three of them to restrain him because he kept trying to jump back on the bully. He got suspended for a week, other kid got 2 weeks for starting it. When he came back it was pretty rare for someone to outright insult him after that. He was just smiles and laughter with his friends, though.",

I made a couple friends there and one of them was very quiet and relatively shy but still an all around cool dude. There was also the stereotypical asshat at the camp and would always sneak up to me and my friend group and pull one of our legs out from under us, making us trip and fall. He would do this all the time. At the tennis courts, at the pool, in the hangout area... He wouldn't stop even though we told him to multiple times. We never went to the camp counselors though because even though it was annoying, it didn't really bother us that much. At least that's what I thought. The shy kid, we can call him Jack, got his leg pulled from under him on our way to the driving range in the golf course area. He was obviously very angry but kept his cool and told the asshole kid to back off. Now we're at the driving range and about 10 minutes in, Mr. Shit-For-Brains thinks it's a great idea to do the same damn prank on Jack again so he sneaks up and pulls his leg out from under him. The asshole didn't connect the dots that we're at the driving range and everyone has a driver in their hands. After Jack falls on the ground, he stands up, whips his head around, sees the asshole, and fuckin' smashes his knees in with the golf club. Now he's laying down on his stomach, reaching for his legs but Jack doesn't take any extra time to beat this asshole's back into the ground. By the time the counselors got to them, the asshole's back was bloody and bruised and Jack already did as much damage as he could. Jack strangely didn't get kicked out of camp after that but the asshole never came back. TLDR: Shy kid at a summer camp beats the bully with a golf club after being tripped by the bully multiple times. ",

Two weeks later, he was home, with a medical discharge. After Basic, I was on casual status while awaiting the start of my Tech School, and I got friendly with our Training Instructors. One told me that they had suspected that my friend was someone who couldn't take pressure, i.e., someone who might crack in a dangerous or critical situation, so he messed up the closet, with the expected results. On a brighter note, when my friend got home, he soon married his girlfriend, whose father got him into the Philadelphia Fire Department, where he served with distinction, retiring as a lieutenant.

I lived with the guy, so I knew he spent all of his money on alcohol and parties, whereas I had to \"persuade\" the landlord to wait ever longer because the payments are coming. So that's the prelude. Fast forward to a night where some of my friends came over and we were chilling in the kitchen, playing some games, drinking and whatever. He joined us, but that's okay, we had some common friends. It was fucking warm in the middle of the summer, and I turned on the AC unit, and he started bitching how we should turn it off because *of the fucking bills*. Okay, I told him it's really too warm for so many people in the room, but then he said something that triggered the fuck out of me: *then I won't pay the electricity bill*. Remember how he was already late with the bills? I absolutely fucking snapped, slammed my fist on the table and started yelling as loud as I could: *the fuck you won't pay the fucking bills you fucking swine. Just look at the fucking mess we're all forced to put up with, I will rip out your fucking guts and feed them to you, you <insert random obscenities>*. Dead silence in the room. Everyone was in shock and I was literally shaking from anger. If he made any more retorts, I would have decked him for sure. I've had grand total of 3 fights in my life, only one as an \"adult\", so I am not that violent even though I am 1.9m and 85kg.

After awhile of us sitting in silence trying to ignore him the football player says \"you should kill you self like your sister\". After he walks away I say something along the lines of \"don't listen to him he's an ass\". But for the first time since I came to the school (this was about a couple months after my transfer) he spoke. He says to me \"I'll be back in a minute\". And I watch him go. He was a short guy probably 5'5 while the football player was easily 6'2. He grabs one of our thick 500+ page chemistry books and just plows it into the back of the football players head. He then proceeded to smash the book against his head some more as he was knocked out on the floor. He did that for several minutes and nobody did anything. Then he calmly walked back over to our lab station and was like \"where were we again\" I was deadass speechless. ",

He's this small scrawny kid that didn't speak too great english and being from a different country and all pretty much kept to himself. I decided to befriend him and we got along pretty well - as well as you could when you can't really communicate too well. Enter the douchebag. Douchebag was about two years older than us, and pretty much a bully. He also loved to pick on said thai boy because he was different and because douchebag thought he was the shit. Anyway Douchebag would pick on Thai boy, and send him home with scrapes and bruises etc. Typical bully behavior. One day though, Douchebag and his posse confronts me and Thai boy as we were leaving the school, challenges thai boy to a fight and got his posse to basically beat the crap out of me. Thai boy is being pushed around by douchebag and basically being pounded on. Thai boy is visibly distraught and keeps going \"no fight no fight\". Then douchebag spits in his face. Now we see Karmic Justice in all its beauty. Thai boy's face completely changes, he grabs douchebag by his shoulders, pins him to the chainlink fence with his body and proceeds to knee and kick the living shit out of him. Douchebag can be seen trying to escape but Thai boy seems to have more strength than his small frame suggests. Douchebag finally collapses clutching his abdomen and literally pleading for Thai boy to stop. Never bothered Thai boy again. When i asked Thai boy why he would wait so long to fight back, Thai boy says something like - \"Back in Thailand, I fight every day, I Muay Thai from 4 year old. Pain is nothing, but he spit on my face. Face important, spit on face unforgivable.\" Apparently he's was a junior muay thai champion before he moved to my country. holy shit.",

                    "body": "Oh wow, an AskReddit I can actually answer. About a month before this night, I had broken up with a guy I had been on and off again dating for 4.5 years. It was a messy, stupid breakup and I was trying to move past it and had already started dating again. It was the summer and I was single for the first time in a long time and I was living a pretty hedonistic life. I had moved on from him. So it's the night before my 23rd birthday and I have to be up early the next day. It's about ten minutes after midnight and i wake from a dead sleep to him calling me a few times in a row. I answer it, annoyed. He's asking me if my \"new dude\" is over at my house right now because it's now officially my birthday and he's ten minutes away from my house. I tell him he's nuts and not to come over and that I'm sleeping alone and need to be up early so to stop calling. He starts sobbing on the phone, screaming about how he knows I'm lying and that he's only five minutes away from my house anyway so he'll see for himself. A few minutes later, he's knocking on my door. He hadn't really ever shown erratic or violent behavior before, so I didn't really see the harm in opening the door to show him that I was in fact alone and just trying to sleep. I let him inside and he was crying and looked very upset and told me that he knew that I was dating someone new. I didn't want to set him off further so I just kind of sat him on the couch to calm him down. He hugged me and cried and woke up my roommate so he suggested we go outside to smoke and talk. I agreed and we sat on the porch and he just vented to me about how upset he was about us breaking up and imaging me with someone else. I tried to keep him calm while explaining to him that I didn't love him any more and that my heart had already moved on, and that he should try and do the same with a girl he had mentioned going on a few dates with. He then got really angry rather than sad and yelled at me asking if I loved this new guy already. I said \"well, he does treat me better than you ever did....\" and all of a sudden his eyes just went dark. I saw all his personality drain from his body and he jumped up from his chair and stormed out the gate in to the front yard. He began screaming at the top of his lungs and throwing his brand new iPhone into the ground over and over. I ran inside and told my roommate what was going on and she went with me outside to try and get him to come inside and calm down and not make a scene. He screamed even louder, spiking his phone into the sidewalk again and again. I told him I was going inside and he could either leave or come in and behave like an adult, or I was going to call the cops for being disruptive. He got in his car and sped off, so my roommate and I went inside. By this point it's about 1 am and we both agree to go back to bed to try and get some sleep before we had to be up at 5. Half an hour later, he's knocking on my door again. Ringing the doorbell over and over till my roommate went and answered to tell him to piss off and leave me alone. As soon as she opens the door, he's yelling past her for me to come out. I tell him from the hallway to leave or I would call the cops and he quiets down. Pulls my roommate outside for a minute and talks to her at a normal volume, so I come out of the hallway. He's standing in the doorway of the house with a dozen red roses in plastic, and a card in an envelope. He hands them to my roommate and turns around and walks back to the front yard. I take the card and open it- it's a singing card from Walmart and inside he wrote \"Vegasarah will you marry me? I fully expect a no answer but I had to ask.\" And there's a $200 silver band cubic zirconia engagement ring from Walmart that is 5 sizes too large in the envelope with the card. I'm stunned and can't even begin to process everything that had just happened, my roommate is equally at a loss. I peek out the window and see he's still in the front yard, waiting for an answer on his marriage proposal I guess but has no phone because he smashed it not 30 minutes ago into my driveway.... I gather myself and tell my roommate to watch everything from the door in case something happens and I go out front. He is sitting on the hood of his card with his head in his hands. I calmly tell him how unfair it is of him to be acting like this on my birthday and that he needs to leave. He just says \"so I guess that's a no, then?\" And I tell him that's correct. He stood up, looked at me and said \"okay, then I'm going to go kill myself then. I have the perfect place to do it- you all will never find my body. \" And then tried to get inside his car to leave. I grab his shirt and arms to try and get the keys from his hand but he pushed me down on the driveway and jumped in the car and locked the doors. His window was down and I ran to it and tried to stop him from backing out of the driveway, telling him if he tried to leave I would call 911, his mom, his dad, his sister, and his best friend in that order. He just screamed more about how I'll never find his body and backed out of the driveway on to the street. I ran after him and stood in front of the car, hands on the hood begging him not to leave. I screamed to my roommate to call 911 with his plate # and make and model of his car. He threw the car in reverse, and then tried to go around me, almost hitting me, and drove off. I called everyone I said I would, and only his best friend answered. He luckily got how serious it was and said he was on it. I stumbled back inside, not knowing what to do. The cops were on the lookout for him and I just sat there in a daze with my roommate. It's around 2 am now and we are exhausted and way too worked up to sleep. His dad called me back and got the story of what happened and seemed really sorry towards me for everything. They haven't found him, they are looking everywhere and are trying to figure out where he could have gone. Just then, he knocks on my door again. I'm of course so relieved and keep his dad on the phone and open the door and tell him to come inside. I stood in front of the door so he couldn't get past me to leave again and told him to talk to his dad. He does, calms down, and passes the phone back to me. His dad tells me to get him to the nearest hospital and he will handle calling off the search and everything. He has physically calmed down by this point, even though he can't talk much and is crying, I get him to let me drive him to the hospital. I stayed with him till his parents arrived and went home. By the time I got home, it was time for me to wake up... He went to a 2 week stay in a mental health facility, and I even visited him when he was in there. Through the whole thing, he never got back the soul I saw drain out of his face on the back porch that night. His brain broke. It was really scary to witness and be a part of. ",

A couple of days after they moved in we were playing in their backyard. The dad came out and was tossing the football with us. I could tell that something was off about him. After tossing the ball for awhile he sat down on a lawn chair and watched us all play. We played for a little while longer and I noticed that my little sister was no longer with us in the yard. I went to go find her. I found the dad and my little sister on the side of the house. Nothing nefarious was happening that I could tell. I grabbed her hand and we left. Once home my sister told my dad that he had rubbed on her bottom and her chest. My dad turned purple, and stormed out of the house. I chased after him, at this time I had no knowledge that he had touched her. My dad walked up on the front step and just walked in like he owned the fucking place. The wife screamed at my dad, and told him to get out. As my dad was walking out the door we heard a car start up, Touchy McToucherson was trying to high tail it away from my irate father. My dad picked up a rock or brick, can't remember which, and ran towards the car. Before he reached the car he hurled the brick at the side window, and shattered it (this was back before safety side windows). He reaches in to the car and drags this asshole out, who is screaming like a little girl. Then proceeds to punch, kick, and stomp him into a pulp in his own driveway while his family watched. The wife had called the cops and they had just arrived as the beating was wrapping up. The cops pull my dad away, and handcuff him. My dad did not spend one single night in jail and no charges were filed. If they were filed nothing ever came of it. (Small NE Texas town)",

I was pushing my son along in his stroller when a male nurse, who on any other day I would not have even thought of messing with, started coming up along the sidewalk going the opposite direction of us. As he was about to pass by us, he finished his cigarette and flicked it away, where it was hit by a light wind gust, and landed right in my sons stroller... Next thing I remember was being dragged off this guy by my friend and looking down at this guy bleeding profusely in multiple places and screaming bloody murder that I was going to kill him. Now I'm about 6'1\"-6'2\" 200lbs this guy had a few inches and likely 50-60 lbs on me but I apparently went full Hulk on him according to my friend. Threw him on the ground and started beating the piss out of him. He ended up running off while I was still screaming at him. TL;DR - You hurt my kids and I'll fucking end you!",

She also have a little piggy nose. I didn't have alot of friends and being friends with Angie was entertaining. We caught the same bus home, and all the school's footballers would sit in the backseat and bully people on the bus. They started bullying Angie because she wouldn't take their shit. For months they called her piggy or snorted at her, threw apple cores at her etc. because we were on a school bus, there wasn't much to do. While this was all happening, Angie kept telling them, \"you guys keep doing this and my brother will beat the shit out of you.\" So one day, I happen to be walking by and see Angie's brother (who doesn't come to school alot but he was in Year 12), he had a rage in his eyes that scared me, so I turned to see where he was going. He walked up to the two main footballers (huge) that had been teasing Angie and just laid into them. In three punches they were both knocked out. These footballers were much bigger than Angie's brother, but her brother just happened to be a boxing champion. As soon as teachers showed up, he stopped and went peacefully to the office. It was like a switch turned on, and then he turned it off.",

I just got out of gym and saw that someone had jacked my clothes out of my locker (ripping the lock off in the process and rendering it useless), tossed them in the urinal, and pissed all over them. Coach had a damn good idea of who it was, but the kid was the captain of the soccer team, and his family were major donors to the school district, so he was effectively untouchable. Same guy got up on me again at lunch (this part was a regular occurrence), asking me why I was still in my gym clothes (with that sarcastic-ass tone that just drips \"I did it\"), and then knocked my lunch all over the floor. I snapped - the last thing I remember was getting up, and the next thing I know, there's busted glass all over the floor around him. According to the school, I hadn't beaten him up, but I had grabbed him by the collar and thrown him hard enough to put him through a double-paned glass door 5 feet away. Keep in mind, I was no bodybuilder - I weighed maybe 150, 5'7, and did almost no exercise. Got off pretty light though - a week of \"alternative school\", which was literally me coming in and doing my homework assignments at night.",

My daughter was playing with something (I don't remember what) and the kid shoved it in her face. It left a mark and made her bleed a little. As the kids were getting off of the bus, the kid said something to my daughter, and my son just popped him one! Right in the face! he got off the bus, told me what happened, and said to expect a call from the bus driver. So, I thanked my son for standing up for his sister and told him I would handle the bus driver. That call never came.",

The soldier in question snapped after listening to a 10 year old male sex slave screaming as the warlord raped him. The soldier snapped, burst into the compound, and beat the warlord to death. Apparently most of these warlord allies engage in human trafficking, pedophilia, and rape, and the worst part is the soldiers can't do anything to stop it. Boys and girls ages 6-12 trafficked for sex and the soldiers have to stand by and let it happen. Truly a disgusting practice. ",

I wanted to be a copy editor, but once upon a time I took an Americorps position teaching inner city elementary schoolers in Brooklyn, NY. My coworkers were similarly untrained. There was a great deal of horrible abuse that took place in that building, some by my coworkers. I was constantly on disciplinary probations for making complaints, refusing to participate in humiliating \"teaching\" practices, etc. I'm frankly ashamed I did so little for some of the more egregious abuse I witnessed. My job became wandering the halls consoling sobbing children. I digress. One day I was working on a lesson plan next to a one-on-one tutoring session between my coworker and a highly traumatized 7-year-old girl. She spoke in whispers, clearly ashamed to be breathing and taking up space in the world. My coworker impatiently called the child \"stupid\" as she struggled with reading (you know, the subject it's your fucking JOB to teach her). I called her a useless cunt, told her to leave, locked the door behind her (a huge NO alone with kids). 30 minutes later, I have no lesson plan, but there's a little girl in my lap who dried her tears and is ready to try reading. She was a brilliant reader with a strong, clear voice that I will always remember. I got written up once again for interrupting that lesson. Fuck you, Cecelia or whatever the fuck your stupid name was, you useless cunt. That child was beautiful. And that's essentially why I work in therapeutic early intervention to this day.",

During this time, my sister was pregnant, she had just found out, but she wasn't getting much sleep because of the parties, their bedroom wall was shared with the party house. Her boyfriend spoke to them politely, he knocked on the wall, he yelled out turn the music down etc. this happened over a couple of months.Unfortunately during that time, my sister miscarried so emotions were high, and then that week, more fucking parties. Finally, one night, he snapped. He is a big Mexican dude, prob 6'4 and fucking ripped. He is a really nice guy but I saw a rage in him that even scared me. He stormed over there and screamed \"Turning the fucking music off\" and then ripped into the little shits, \"telling them if they didn't knock it off he would make them and that his girlfriend had suffered a miscarriage and it was all their fault because she wasn't getting enough rest because of their stupid parties\" Should have seen their faces drop. It did the trick tho, no more parties after that and my sister got pregnant again and had a little boy. :)",

On and on until the kid who is usually able to keep his cool snaps and acts with violence against his bully. Or, worse, premeditates an attack like stabbing them with the pencil. Then suddenly you're the school who's not doing enough. Kids will be kids but violence comes with a zero tolerance policy at most schools. So people realized that situations like the above happen and you're expelling a kid who was a victim all along. So they take it a step further. Both kids involved in an act of violence will be expelled. That will catch those bullies that antagonized this other kid into action. Suddenly you're the crazy school who's expelling kids who get punched. Why are you expelling victims? You can't prove that the kid who got hit instigated it over a period of weeks or years. Bullying is a really complex issue and it ripples into so many other parts of the education system. There's not any easy, catch-all solution. The best route we have is to nip it in the bud, stop the bullies before they become bullies. But that's going to require way more one-to-one analysis, care, and treatment, than public education can afford. Especially under this administration.

My parents weren't great about that until high school, but by then I'd kind of matured and it wasn't as much of an issue. I went to a private school till around 7th grade, where I was bullied really badly and I kept it mostly to myself because I didn't have great communication with my parents. They're fantastic people and I'm so lucky to have them, but we never really knew how to talk to eachother till I hit highschool, so I never had anybody I could go to about the bullying. At home I pretended like everything was okay, but at school it was rough. When I hit 7th grade, I finally broke it to them and got switched to public school (where I was treated a lot better and made actual friends). They eventually sat me down and told me I could tell them anything. If I was 16 and got drunk at a party, I could call them to come pick me up and get me home safe. As long as I didn't end up in jail or seriously hurt, I didn't have to worry about their reactions to what I did. Having that alone helped so much. Just knowing that I wouldn't be judged and I wouldn't get in trouble as long as I was open with them saved me from a lot of stress. Basically, just make sure your kid can talk to you, make sure you listen and treat your kid like an equal when talking about serious things, he should turn out just fine. Edit: something else I thought I mentioned but I guess I didn't: Find ways to give your kid self confidence. Martial arts is probably the best way I can think of to do this. It's basically a group of people all working towards a goal together, encouraging eachother. I never got into it, but I recently (I'm 20 now) started boxing with some friends, and learning it has boosted my self confidence by miles. If I had a structure like this back in 6th or 7th grade, it would have made a massive difference. It's not knowing you're able to beat someone up or knowing you're able to defend yourself, it's just a sense of accomplishment and security. ",

Anyways, for some reason he singled me out and constantly talked to shit me and ripped on me for whatever he could think of. I just ignored it because it was just some tiny kid trying to be tough. Until one morning on the bus, I think I was very tired and grumpy. He sat behind me with a soccer ball and proceeded to start bouncing off the back of my head. I had enough, stood up and turned around. He almost pissed himself as I leaned over the seat towards him, he slid down the seat but couldn't get away. I grabbed him by the shirt, punched him a few times in the face, then dropped him and sat back down. Didn't say anything to him and no one else saw it. Little bastard left me right the hell alone after that. Only time I ever hit anyone too. I'm a lover, not a fighter. ",

At some point I just gave up trying to get their love and support and stopped caring about being obedient. I hit my mom a few times as a kid out of sheer desperation for someone to notice how fucked up our lives were. It was the only way to separate myself from her because she would push us away, watch us fail, and then use that failure as justification for restrictions. Then we would be stuck at home to be her emotional slaves.

I was working on a tax question with a 600-word limit. I had taken my usual approach of writing the answer I wanted to write, and then trying to edit it down to the limit. I had been working on it for a couple of hours and was down to 626 words and really struggling to find anything else to cut. I decided to take a break. Being very casual about things like saving my work, I hadn't saved anything. In keeping with the casual approach, I tended to save while exiting Word, rather than save and then exit. So I hit \"Exit\" and the \"Do you want to save your work\" dialog box popped up with options of Yes, No and Cancel. However behind the dialog box I had spotted a typo in my text. I figured \"I'd better fix that now before I take a break\". Thinking \"No, I don't want to exit\", I hit \"No\". Of course that wasn't the question. So I had managed to exit without saving. Once the horror subsided and I had confirmed that I hadn't saved along the way, I decided \"OK, forget the break, I need to do this again while it's fresh\". So I tapped out an answer that I thought was very similar to the one I had previously. Because it was fresh in my mind it only took about 30 mins. I checked the word count... 598 words. I still don't know what I left out. ",

Little dude turns on me, huffing and puffing and making \"I'm gonna kill you\" face and stomps up to me. So I lift my leg, plant my foot on his chest and \"shove/kick\" him over.

Anyway, lunch time, asshole comes up to me, starts harassing me, pulling at my clothes, calling me names, typical shit. Then he brings up my mom, saying something like \"The reason you're in foster care is because your mom didn't want you anymore.\" Next thing I remember, I'm literally sitting on his head with glass scattered everywhere. Apparently I grabbed him and slammed him into a window before tackling him and sitting on his head.

My mother always had mental issues before we were even born (According to my father, she was constantly paranoid about people following her, even going so far as to getting the police involved who got tired of her calling them up for her false alarms). My parents split up when i was young. About 5-6 years old. Mother got custody of us kids. Afterwards it was downhill from there. Mother turned mean, vicious, cruel, and abusive towards us kids. Always yelling, screaming, cursing (and sometimes hitting) everyday of the week. She never acted this way towards us kids before the split. Something about it mustve worsened her mental condition. I'll give you another example of her craziness and abuse. I do not recall how old I was at the time of this incident. Maybe around 8-10 years old. One morning i woke up with a start to the sight of my mother hitting me over and over again while cursing me out. Every syllable she punctuated with another hit. \"You (whap!) fuck (whap!) ing (whap!) son (whap!) of (whap!) a (whap!) bitch (whap!) bas (whap!) tard (whap!)\" Etc, etc. I cried out, \"what did i do???? What did i do????\" My mother then stopped hitting me and said, \"Oh. Oh. You're asleep? Oh.\" And then she turned around and walked away as if nothing had happened. I laid there wondering what the hell just went on and why. To this day i do not know what brought that on, aside from my mothers mental illness. I do not know if sister exactly hates spinach, but i have never known her to eat it since then. I think it has affected her permanently in a negative way. Neither of us kids went on to get married or have kids of our own to this day. ",

There was so much variety it made it fun plus it paid really well. If I didn't have a calling to work in the medical field I would go back in a heart beat. It's just that at his time the cons outweigh the pros. It helps a ton knowing I could go back and have a job for me.

After awhile I was able to talk to my dad enough to decide that I wanted to live with him. I filed the papers and it took 2 years for it to get accepted. In those papers I stated how my mom treated me, but I still had to stay with her while all of the processes happened. That was probably the worst part about it, saying that my mother was abusive and the courts saying I had to stay with her until it was all over.",

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\" ",

Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.",

Darth Trump was a Dark Lord of the Alt-Right, so bigly and so tremendous that he could influence his supporters to lie about pretty much everything. He had such a knowledge of alternative facts that he could even keep the more qualified candidates he was running against... from winning. The Alt-Right is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be undemocratic. He became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was having a small inauguration crowd, which eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught Steve Bannon everything he knew, then Steve Bannon took over the government in his sleep. It's ironic; he could save others from fake news, but not himself. Sad!",

Bringing the conversation back to sex EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I'd ask about what he did for work, he'd tell me then ask if I owned dildos. I would ask where he went to school. He'd ask if I minded if guys didn't wear condoms. I'd ask what he does for a hobby. He'd ask if I'm open to threesomes. 3. Focusing on my looks to a really uncomfortable degree. I don't mind a compliment, but one guy actually checked to see if I have all my teeth, and noticed an abrasion on my arm from work and asked \"hm, is that permanent?\". I said, no it was just a scrape, and tried to move the conversation to something else and he started to ask if I've ever modelled, and what sort of modelling, and do I have photos with me?

Moment we stepped out of the coffee shop things went from 0-100 real fast. * Started saying \" Why do girls want expensive restaurant shit like these* starts pointing at every resto we passed by. I havent suggested a place where to eat * Started cussing profoundly as we were walking. He was super polite when we had coffee but became a real jerk * I noticed he was a penny pincher which he admitted. So I chose to eat at a taco stand and we go dutch. * I spent 6$ on my shrimp taco and he spent $7.50 on his fish ones. Didnt order drinks. Totally flipped why mine is a dollar cheaper than his. Pretty much bummed about it on our awkward dinner. I also found out at this point he hasnt had a GF since he was 16/17. He's 32 now. * Walked him to the train station. Said goodbye, shook his hand and never looked back. First time I ever ghosted anyone.",

I also realize that often exes are relevant parts of any back story, but I'm referring to every other sentence being a reference to her. That is my biggest sign that he's not over his ex. LPT: if a person's identity/title is not relevant in a story you're telling, don't overshare. As far as life differences, a lot of times you meet in person and that's when suddenly the guy mentions that he wants kids badly (I don't) and wants to move out to the suburbs (I double don't). Stuff like that is nobody's fault. But if a dude is fussy to waitstaff, GTFO. Basically, watch him as you walk down the street. If a homeless dude asks for money and he's a jerk to him, take note. Little stuff like that speaks far louder than you think. Specific reasons for not getting a second date with me? 1: one dude said he only went out with me because he liked \"fucked up girls with daddy issues like the chick in requiem for a dream, and thought I looked like I'd be a DTF mess...\" and we both acknowledged that his assessment was incorrect and split ways. 2: dude got trashed, admitted he was an ex convict for selling cocaine and crack to kids, and then proceeded to throw up on my face and in my ear.

I went to college and he went to a votech school. A year or two later we both ended up back in our home town. He wanted to take me out and I agreed, figuring he had matured during his time in votech. So he comes to pick me up at my grandma's house (where I was raised). He drove up with his radio blasting and the windows down. His seat was so far back he could barely see over the dash and was almost laying down. I was raised in a very strict household and he was very familiar with the kinda of things that my family(and I, being raised by them) found acceptable. He peeled out of my grandma's driveway, radio blasting, barely able to see over the wheel. I was so embarrassed. The whole(movie) date he acted like a total ass. He acted like a trashy grease monkey from some sexist muscle car movie the whole time. It was no where near the guy I had spent most of my childhood with. I was so offended that he thought I would even remotely be in to that. I didn't want to go on a date with a muscle head. I wanted to go on a date with they guy who had been my best friend, that shared my love of video games and talked with me about our individual dreams and ideas. There wasn't a second date. Later I found out from his friends (like a year later) that he was telling everyone that we were dating, he was helping pay my bills, and that we were talking about moving in together. I don't really talk to him anymore. TL;DR: Bff turns pretends not to know me, and then wants to go on a date, spends entire date being the exact opposite of himself and offending my family and myself in the process.",

He complained about the music in the restaurant, the speed of service, the food, the coffee afterwards, every god damn little thing. He also had to complain about everything about me. \"You drink *that* wine? That wine is garbage, you should try this one.\" \"How can you listen to this over-masculine rap music when you're a part of a minority? This music is way better.\" \"How can you eat that *without* adding this? My way is better.\" He was so whiny and just sticks out as the most abrasively annoying person I ever met, even in the face of all the other toolbags. **TL;DR:** don't complain. At least attempt to maintain some sort of positive demeanour on a first date. Be polite, be genuine, be respectful.

Fucking disgusting, you don't deserve anything but text saying \"sorry, but no thanks.\" On the flip side, I've had \"hot\" girls be angry at me for not finding them attractive. I'm by no means a stud, but they were used to being fawned over. The fact that I don't want to fuck them but I'm not gay infuriates them. ",

Think about Fairy Tales, the Prince has to jump through hoops of fire to then climb the dangerous high mountain to prove his worth to save the princess. Now think about current movies, the girl totally brushes off the guy at every juncture and he has to prove himself consistently \u2013 and eventually he does end up with said girl. The media has fuelled negative sets of behaviour for males and females. Remember, \u201cPlaying hard to get\u201d? We\u2019ve all heard of it, many females still choose to do it, a man must be shunned \u2013 he must prove himself worthy... However this in turn has created an even more negative behaviour; say a guy approaches a girl at a bar, offers to buy her a drink, she declines because she is genuinely not interested. He is relentless in his pursuit of her. He will try every trick in his pocket. All the girls that have played hard to get; all the times in its various forms where he was told that he must prove himself or be unyielding has taught him not to take no for an answer. And so the poor girl suffers. It\u2019s weird though, girl likes boy, boy like girl... she acts like she doesn\u2019t have any interest in him. Why? Because society has made any girl who shows feelings too quickly to be forward - or has thought said girl that a man must prove himself worthy. It\u2019s such a vicious cycle, she\u2019ll play hard to get \u2013 the innocent guy may just give up and move on. Or, he\u2019ll continuously chase her which then reinforces the behaviour of being persistent which can end up being harassment to a girl who has no legitimate interest in the guy. Vicious cycle indeed. Haha it should be so much simpler, Guy: I think you\u2019re awesome Girl: I think you\u2019re awesome, too. Let\u2019s be awesome together. And they lived happily ever after.

Otherwise, this is a surefire way to make a girl feel like you only are interested in what her body has to offer. There are places on a girl to touch besides her breasts and her ass - don't be the guy that insists on touching them every time you see them (*especially* in public, and yes, even when you don't think anyone is looking, still don't). Hold her hand, touch her arm, her waist, kiss her forehead or cheek, etc - just try to work in more signs of affection that don't scream \"I'm only doing this because it might lead to sex\" or \"My favorite parts of you are obviously your genitals and I'm interested in nothing else.\" That's probably not how guys intend to come across at all, but it's often what ends up being communicated. Girls often have more body boundaries than guys, and you'll be a lot better off if you start off respecting them. Bottom line: girls like to know that guys would still want them even if they didn't have the T&A. We need to know that we're more to you than just convenient sex outlets.",

If I'm going out on a date or out somewhere with my friends I sometimes put on makeup to complete my outfit. And yes because it also makes me feel good to be complimented on it, but 90% of the time it's my female friends doing the complimenting. Stuff like \"Oh that lipstick colour looks good on you.\" Or \"Dude you did your eyeliner REALLY well today.\" Less my actual appearance than the skill involved with making it look good. Sometimes I put it on when I'm home alone because I want to try something out, or I want to take some selfies that will probably never see the light of day, or just cause I'm bored and I like how it looks. The only time I ever put on makeup for a guy specifically is when I'm Domming my boyfriend. Then I put it on partially to enhance my own confidence (because I usually tend more towards sub) as well as to turn him on. And that makeup is different from what I usually do for myself because he has a bit of a goth fetish so I do it thicker and darker than usual. ",

Revered by the students for his eccentricity, his loud voice, and his willingness to go to bat for hia students if they were in trouble. I was one of the \"four year wonders,\" that is someone who joined the drama department at the beginning of freshman year and stayed until graduation. I took every class offered, from acting to directing to tech theater (which is part of yhe reason why I'm now a professional stage hand and have been for the last 10 years). But the lesson in question came from the acting class. Quinn was himself a previous student of Uta Hagen, someone those of you with acting backgrounds will immediately recognize. Quinn taught us Method Acting in the Meisner style. Acting is doing. Become the character. We went through endless Meisner exercises: repetition, the door, the broom, etc. For many students it was just a little too heady to understand. It wasn't until later in life that I realized how important that lesson on \"become the character\" was. Becoming the character of \"the employee\" or \"the boyfriend\" or \"the brother\" made me better in those roles. I was a better employee, a better boyfriend, a better brother. It helped me become more successful and a better person. Sadly, Mr Quinn is no longer with us. Colon cancer had to have it's say. He was diagnosed when I was a senior, and when he had his surgeries there quite literally wasn't a moment when one of his students wasn't at his bedside. Even at 2am on a school day, one of us was there. He initially fought it off, and was around long enough for me to delightedly tell him about my new career in professional theater, and regale him with backstage tales from major Broadway tours. But then the cancer came back, harder and more agressive. He quickly wasted away. I visited him at his home about a month before he passed, because I wanted to tell him about running a production of Die Fledermaus, one of his favorite operettas. Despite his pain, despite his exhaustion, he perked right up to hear what I had to say, and was even able to quietly laugh at some of the foibles the show gave us. When he passed, the school held an enormous memorial service. Over two thousand people attended, the vast majority being former students. We told stories, cried, hugged each other. My sister, another four year wonder, evem sang the old folk song \"The Mighty Quinn\" in his honor. I kinda veered off there from the original question, but I get kinda emotional and nostalgic when I remember those days. They were the overwhelmingly best part of my high school experience. Still miss you, you dumb, dirt-licking gourd-head.",

For half asleep unengaged students with Senor-itiss, it's near impossible. So one day, he changes all the decorations in the room, lays out different books. They walk in, they bell rings, and he begins class saying \"today's going to be a bit of an easy day. My expectation is that you follow along, take notes, and ask questions if absolutely necessary. Since this is a kind of difficult part of *Wuthering Heights* to understand, I'll just be narrating. We'll start where we left off yesterday, everyone open your books to page 67\" It works. Every year. No one has questions. They kind of like question if this is really happening, and then get on board. A few pick up on it immediately, and have a goofy smile all of class. But for the half engages kid who now has an entire our to quietly wonder what the fuck is going on, they realize - almost always - that it's an example of double speak. At the end of class, he has a 5 minute PowerPoint on 1984. If questioned, he just says \"I'm reaching *1984*. I've always been teaching *1984*\", and moves on. Never admits to anything, just like the party wouldn't. It's freaking genius, hilarious, and it works.",

Really bad at running, could barely make a mile back then (still cant) and he'd stop by while running and make sure I was okay. Gave me a simple nod and smile every time. Freshman year of college there was news that he committed suicide after finding out he had some incurable illness that would leave his family (2 young boys) in a lot of financial trouble. He was depressed and decided that life insurance was an answer to ensure his family's well being. Broke my heart when my friend told me about it, I think it's the only time I've cried about a death. Now, I'm about to graduate at a top university in Psychology, have a huge background in research, working 3 labs my senior year, applying and have been accepted into a few post bac (premed) programs and grad programs and I have him to thank.

Featuring a student who had a passionate argument with himself, periodically swirling a cape around to indicate which character he was at any given time. 2. \"We Thought We Were Doing This on Friday: The Musical\" was a slightly-less-than-polished (they presented on Thursday) rendition of a scene in which a ghost is at the narrator's window. They set the scene, introduced the ghost, and then the narrator was trying to get rid of the ghost. \"Let me go, let me go\"/\"I will not let you go\" quickly turned into Bohemian Rhapsody. Most of the class joined in singing, and we went through the entire song together. There were enough people involved that I could even sing\u2014in public!\u2014knowing that my tone-deaf warbling would be covered up by other people's voices.

I was fortunate enough to attend the \"better education\" system in my city, and most of the teachers there genuinely cared about their students and were doing their job because they loved it and not because they had no other option. A lot of my memories come from 10th grade. I had an AP Language teacher that was always enthusiastic with her kids and excited to be there, and even though it was one of the toughest classes since she gave very few people As, I looked forward to it almost every day since she just had this charm that made us interested in the material. The other AP Language teacher wrote personalized motivational notes for every single student he had, and gave them to his students the day before the AP exam. I have a few more favorites. My IB Chem teacher in 11th grade has a Ph.D like most of the AP science teachers at my school. Most of them could've done something better but instead they chose to teach (Or maybe this was the only job they could get, but at least they showed enthusiasm when teaching). Anyways, he was basically Mr.Rogers to us. First day of school, he spoke in this soothing soft voice and said something like this \"Don't be afraid to ask us, we're just like you, we're not going to judge you, I understand what you're going through. Come by any time and I'll work things out with you. If you're having problems, I'll sit by you and work them out with you. Don't think of us as robots that spawn in the classroom everyday, remember that we're humans that care about you.\" Once a week, he'd give us life lessons and give us a piece of motivational advice or perhaps some information on how to pay bills or how to fix a car, etc. During school events, he'd always dress up, and wore silly costumes during Halloween and before Christmas break to make his kids laugh, and even built a Christmas tree made out of lab materials with us. He actually gave us personalized gift bags with candy and other goodies for Christmas, and made the class very enjoyable by showing that he actually cared about his students. He actually invited us to his band concert events, and I went to them with a few friends and had some outside interaction with him which was nice since I got to see another side of him. I have so many more examples, but it would take me hours to write. Thank you to all dedicated teachers who chose to be one in order to make a difference. Everyone emphasizes doctors, engineers, and scientists, but it's people like you who create them and start the change :) EDIT: Why is this getting downvoted? ",

Not thinking anything of it class went on as normal my teacher arrived a little late which was weird but didnt really make a difference. The next day same thing happened and I was wondering how this was happening. I erased it again and asked some students if they knew what was up. No one did. Again the teacher was late and walked in sternly but relaxed once he looked towards where the fuck you was written. The next day I walk in and it wasnt there. I thought okay cool no one did it this time great. Once my teacher walked in he walked directly to the board and rolled up the projector screen and saw a fuck you. He gasped and began to be furious. He eventually calmed down to explain he was the one writing the fuck yous because he wanted to teach the part of the book where Dunstan tries to erase them in NY so his sister keeps her innocence. In turn I actually did what Dunstan was trying to do which was meta af. Great story which I still tell people and he does to!",

I had her as a freshman for algebra and I was a little SHIT (like 99.99999% of high school freshman are) and she NEVER gave up on me or anyone in that class. She wanted to see you graduate and go on to college or trade school or whatever, no matter how shitty your home life was. She listened to your problems and got resources for kids whose families could not afford things like eyeglasses or insurance and helped kids who needed it get on free or reduced lunch (I went to a high school where there were fairly rich well off families and others on the polar opposite side). She was not afraid to yell at you and call your mom/dad, but she always said she loved you and cared. If you needed food or supplies, she would either give it to you or sell it to you for like 50 cents or $1, which was over 1/2 the price of the school food. She treated her peer tutors like family. I peer tutored and one day she gave all the peer tutors fresh loaves of bread to take home to their families and always offered us fresh bagels or other things to take home. She always asked how my mom was and remembered I had a brother and when I mentioned his name always referred to him by name after that (which one teacher who I had for 4 years didn't even know I had one or his name until I was a sophomore and didn't remember his name until I was a junior) even though he didn't come to my school and wouldn't. Even if you didn't have her and you came in to her room, there was always the offer of food and support. She probably singlehandedly was the reason a few kids graduated and walked across that stage. She took the time to explain not only math, but if something was going on in the world, she made sure you knew that things were going on outside of our town. She honored the arts and those who did them in a school where sports were king. She was the first and only of the teachers to call when a classmates father passed away to check to see what she could do for the family and how they were doing, who had come from another country some years prior and didnt have much, if at all, in country family. It wasn't just that she was a great teacher, but all the extra she did on top of it. Ms H at CHS, thank you. There was also the math teacher who would throw an event for all the drama kids after the plays and made sure that they knew how much they were recognized in the school. And the wonderful science department, full of former researchers who worked at UCs and in labs, who practically let me live in the building for my first 2.5 years of high school while my parents worked a lot and were who I would call my second through seventh moms.",

We spent a full week acting, editing, and doing this crazy stuff because we loved what we learned so much. We ended up getting like 145 points with extra credit, the highest grade he's given out still I believe. His usage of gumby was always odd to us because while we thought it was funny usually, it didn't make any sense that he had this obsession with a random character. But on the last day of class he told us why he loved Gumby. Gumby was a piece of dough that could turn himself into anything that he needed to to complete a task. He told us how any of us could mold ourselves for what lied ahead, and to adapt to the challenges facing us. Gumby was the hero he could be and we all could become the hero we could be, and we shouldn't let a boxes in school, society, or life ever hold us back.

One day, the wife is shopping for dinner when she notices a new brand of ham on display. She asks the kid behind the counter what ham it is. \"Oh, that's Dam Ham.\" The wife replies \"You know, young man, you really shouldn't be using foul language in front of the preacher's wife\"! The employee explains \"Oh, no! That's the name of the brand: Dam Ham, with just the m.\" \"Oh, OK. I think I'll have some of this Dam Ham\"! So she goes home and starts making dinner. A few hours later, the preacher returns home. \"Hey honey, what's cooking\"? The wife tells him \"That's Dam Ham honey.\" Shocked, the preacher berates her \"Now we're a godly family, and you know if we start cussing inside the home it's only a matter of time before we start cussing in public.\" The wife explains \"Oh, no, I wasn't cussing! That's what the brand is called\"! The preacher says \"Well that's all right then. It's delicious too, I can't wait for supper.\" Finally, Junior gets home from school, so they gather around the table while the preacher leads them in prayer. After he finishes his famously long prayer, the preacher turns to his wife and says, \"Pass me some of that Dam Ham, honey.\" Junior is floored. Not once in his life has he ever heard his father say a bad word. After a long pause, Junior says \"That's the spirit, Dad! And while you're at it, pass me some of the fucking mashed potatoes\"!\" Needless to say, Mr. Rush became our favorite teacher after that.",

He asked us to wait until the whole class showed up to explain the shorts. He'd gotten to the school before almost any other staff, and went to take a dump. For some reason, he flushed before he stood up, and the used toilet overflowed into his pants. Having a time limit, (can't be doing this with students in the building), and nobody around to help him, he had to discard his underwear, pull up a pair of soiled jeans, and waddle to the locker room, which was three floors down and a couple hundred feet away.

I carried that folder everywhere (I had drawing folders all the way through college, even,) and always made sure to have it ready to go for art club after school. I guess this one day, I was feeling really shitty about my artistic ability, because all I can remember is not being able to draw a single thing and crying at the desk. I couldn't accept that I'd never get any better, and in a fit of frustration I threw my beloved art folder in the art room trash can. I stormed out and went home and felt miserable all night. I really regretted throwing out my folder the next morning, and it killed me inside knowing that it was probably at the bottom of the dumpster outside. I felt terrible until I slowly meandered up the stairs to the art room for art class and saw Ms. G, standing outside the classroom door, smiling and holding out my folder. I was so relieved! My folder, and all of my drawings! Ms. G hadn't let me throw them away, she saved them! I was so grateful, I hugged her, and she told me to never stop drawing. I'm not a pro by any means, but I still haven't stopped drawing. Ms. G knew I wouldn't want to quit forever, and I can't thank her enough for saving my art.",

If you were too afraid to do certain things like a handstand, she offered assistance but you were allowed to stick to easier things. You had 2 \"free passes\" in each semester which meant that if you notified her before, you wouldn't be listed absent, without any questions asked, and you could do this 2 times.

In the same lesson, we learned about survival skills. We went in the school yard and used magnifying glass to make fire. He was teaching us how to do it and explaining light, etc... When we smell fire and see smoke. Two class clowns decided to start without him and set our school yard on fire. I didn't personally see it, but I'm pretty sure they had a lighter to aid the process. (It was fall in Texas...dry, hot, and dead grass). It spread really fast. By this point, the whole class is trying to stomp at the fire. One kid runs in to grab a fire extinguisher. About that time, we hear the fire alarm go off, all the kids are filing out (this was before cell phones, so someone must have called 911 on the inside) and we then hear the fire trucks (right down the road from school). They get the fire put out, my teacher gets a slap on the wrist and all is well. We come back inside and he carries on about the lesson like we didn't almost catch the school on fire. Great teacher and I learned more about life from that guy than I did from any other teacher. TL; DR: Physics teacher gives lesson on light and kids light school yard on fire. ",

Well, one day we were doing a writing prompt about Christmas and this girl randomly asked, \"Mr. X, how do you say 'fuckits' in English?\" She got flustered but the teacher and the class thought it was funny!",

She then told us that anyone with brown eyes wasn't allowed to talk to or play with anyone with blue eyes for the rest of the class. We couldn't share snacks, use the same bathroom or even drink from the same water fountain. None of us talked to Brooke or played with Brooke, some of us didn't even look at Brooke. The lesson (which was supposed to last the entire class time) was cut short an hour in when Brooke's best friend burst into hysterical tears. \"I don't care about her eyes, she's my friend.\" This was followed by an orchestra of crying five years olds pleading with our teacher to let Brooke talk to us again.

Anyway, the biggest project of the year was we had to find someone from our home state who died fighting overseas in Iraq/Afghanistan in the years since 9/11. When it came time to present them, there was a very somber mood in the classroom (for obvious reasons), and the teacher played Taps in the background for music while each person went up and talked about the individual. After presenting, the teacher went and put a thumbtack in the map of the state that corresponded with the hometown of where that person was from. The note cards we used carrying that information was hung up on the cabinet and left up there for the rest of the year. Really made the whole assignment hit home when I saw all those thumbtacks in each of those hometowns, realizing that there were only about 25 tacks, but there were thousands of lives lost.

Obviously kids were like \"hey no we have to! It's illegal not to go to school\" to which she responded with \"you're right, but you've probably broken the law before. Have you ever asked yourself why you choose to follow this one?\" That was normal 10th grade English and I ended up liking her class so much that I took the advanced placement English class in 11th grade just because she was the teacher for that class. In 11th grade she taught me that when it comes to learning new things, it's going to be uncomfortable and that means you're learning. She also taught me that a rough draft shouldn't just be edited to be a final draft- you should rewrite the essay without looking at your rough draft and just copying it. This keeps ideas more fluid and you'll have a better flow of ideas than your rough draft did. God I miss her lol. ",

My homework and classwork was always fine but when it came to tests, I always seemed to bomb. It was really discouraging because I knew the stuff, it just couldn't translate. One time I went for extra help, we went over the lesson from the previous class and he gave me a 'practice' worksheet. I finish it, bring it up and he looks over it. Then puts an 'A' at the top of the paper and smiles. It took me a moment but I then I realized he had gave me the test for the next class...I aced it, I was in shock. He said: \"You see? I knew you could do it, you're smart, you just have test anxiety and that's not uncommon\" He figured out that the only reason I was flunking tests was my nerves and lack of confidence, it had nothing to do with me not knowing the material. It was an epiphany for me and my confidence was boosted. He was the only teacher that had ever did that. He really went the extra mile to not only help me, but understand me. I left the extra help session with a weight off my shoulders and from then on (even though math still wasn't my strongest subject) I learned to not psyche myself out so much when it came to tests.

But this letter was nothing but praise for not just my work in his class but just me as a person. The amount of confidence that single letter instilled in me as a freshmen played a pretty big part of me pursuing math in college. The second memory is of one of our lessons on derivatives. We were studying Newton's law of cooling and after studying it in class and working through some problems, he had us all go to the coffee shop nearby. He then bought everyone a drink plus one that he placed in the middle of a table. We all then took measurements and used the law we just learned about to predict the temperature in 20 minutes. It was such a simple demonstration but it was one of the first times I had a math teacher make the application of a lesson fun and applicable to real life. ",

In his psychology class, he had us sit down in a circle for an experiment. We had a box, with poker chips that could be traded in for items from our snack shop. The catch was that it took like three poker chips to pay for like a pack of gum, and there were only four chips, and five or six of us sitting around it, greedy little bastards the lot of them. (I was in the group too, but I was balling) he made one final qualifier before letting us begin struggling over the chips. Every thirty seconds, he would double the number of chips in the box, which meant that we all could have been happily walking away with whatever we wanted, for free. But that's obviously not what happened, he said go, and everyone snatched a worthless chip up, mutually assuring that everyone got the same, nothing.

When I was in my last year of middle school my mom and I decided I should be in home school for a while (I was bullied so bad that a kid slammed a chair into my knee caps till one of them shattered.) My sophomore year of highschool I transferred to a near by public high school. Well turns out none of my credits for freshman year transferred. Not because they weren't compatible but because the school literally DID NOT FILE/DO THE PAPERWORK REQUIRED TO DO IT. So come my senior year my counselor. Who btw literally shows up for 1 class a day to check on football people (he is the football coach) and then leaves for the rest of the day. Calls me into his office to tell me I am 6 credits deficient. It's the end of January now meaning I have like 5 months to make up all 6 credits. He won't give me the information to do this sort of study program that's like 50$ for a book and test for half a credit (for those at home I would have to pay 300$ if I passed them all one try.) I am told to just give up and that I would have to wait a whole 'nother year to graduate which I wasn't about to do. I stopped talking after that (which if you knew me I literally never stop talking,) and 2 days later I go to rehearsal for a play I am in and I am sitting in a chair waiting for it to start. A girl (who I still feel bad for) ask if I am okay and I literally go off, I have never yelled so loud or cry so hysterically. I go into a panic attack and my friend thinks I'm having a heart attack. Well now my teacher walks into the room from his office and he listens to what my friend says, and he calmly calls someone. After I calm down he gives me the biggest fucking hug and told me to come with him. He takes me to the counselor who is essentially the boss of the others. She tells me that it would be hard and that she thinks it would be cheaper to just get a GED and that if I went to a community college and did well I could still go to a great college and do well. I felt so relieved I kept crying. Yo that teacher cared so much about his students I am so happy I had him as a teacher. His class was the highlight of my day and the play was the best part of my week. Also the counselor from the beginning didn't lose his job and still works there and did the same shit to my friends and something similar to my brother. TL;DR has a mental break down over not getting to graduate and my teacher helped me get information to get a GED as well as giving me a hug I dearly needed!",

Don't get me wrong, I had some good teachers early on, but even the good ones tend to just treat you like dumb kids most of the time which - while not entirely untrue - was easy to pick up on even at a young age and made you feel like a bit of a burden. Anyway I don't remember any particular lesson being great, but she was just really personable overall. She would shoot the shit with us, ask us about our interests, ask the girls what the gossip is and who was 'dating' who. I distinctly remember one day in gym class I was feeling pretty down for some reason. She came over and sat down with me on the wall and said \"Are you feeling okay? You're usually pretty uppity but today you seem down.\" and then we just talked for a couple minutes. I hardly remember what it even was about, but I think it was the first time an adult really got down to my level and just listened to me. My parents were bad by any means, but they would often talk down to you or do the general 'listening-but-not-really' thing that a lot of parents do most of the time you spoke to them at length. She also really encouraged my writing, which was something I was interested in from an early age but never confident in. I remember we had some assignment to reinterpret a fairy tale or something and I went all out writing some action adventure epic based on the three pigs, and she told me in front of the class how one of her friends randomly picked it up it at their house when they were entertaining guests and she had our journals for marking, and how he was apparently laughing the whole way through. She then read the whole thing in front of the class, with my permission, and I was positively beaming. I had won 'awards' for the hardcover books we wrote in 2nd or 3rd grades before, but this affirmation felt so much more personal somehow. I had a couple other great teachers from then on, but Mrs. Shuter has always stuck in my memory.",

First of all there was a game he made up: \"Blakester Back-Breaker\". We'd all sit on our desks and throw a ball around; if it made it all the way through, he adds a special action we have to take before catching and/or throwing the ball. If you fail you're out. He was also just a cool fuckin dude; he'd hear out any ideas the kids had and look it up if they didn't know, or if they had video ideas he'd show it and see. He also gave out jolly ranchers which was pretty rad. He was legitimately interested in us and what we wanted to do; I remember I brought up this 80s cover band that would mix songs together and he wanted a CD of them so my dad burned one and I brought in, and got like a fuckin' dozen and a half jolly ranchers, it was dope. He wasn't just a teacher; he was like a friend, and he had a ton of funny or cool stories to tell; I get now they were probably all BS he made up but it was still pretty fun. By the last month before Summer or the week before any break, he'd take out the class and we'd just watch movies. Hell At the end of most days we watched Man va Wild or I'm Alive.

She had said we could use songs or raps if we so chose to do so, and one guy chose a particularly vulgar rap. I don't remember much of it, but one line was \"I'll put your pussy in a coma\" and she immediately quipped \"My pussy's been in a coma for twenty years.\" She was a hoot, I loved her. Unrelated to the story, she would bring us baked treats on Fridays. There was also my 8th grade Advanced Art teacher, who would give us weekly homework. We got to pick five art prompts from a list of eight, and had to draw them in our sketchbooks. Some of them were super random, like \"Draw a brainstorm\" or \"Draw a dancing kitchen utensil\". She was a very jolly woman who genuinely cared about her students, and would sit down at each of our group tables just to see how we were doing and offer critiques on our work. One time she wanted to help me with a painting technique, so I let her take my seat and paintbrush. After she was done, she continued to paint and wouldn't give me back my paintbrush because she was having too much fun with my idea.

Well this one time, the group of kids run up to play in the river and they get stopped by one of the warriors in the tribe. This is how Carlo would say it: \"Wait,\" said our protector, and we asked him \"why? It's hot and the water is cool.\" Then the tribesman pointed to the water, \"you see those bubbles?\" And of course we saw the bubbles. \"There is a crocodile in the water.\" Carlo died 16 days ago.

He did teach me something no one else ever did though when he told the class one day, \"No use digging in your brain for something that isn't there.\" Many might think it was a bad thing to say, but it opened my eyes. Sometimes you do need to let go. I didn't study enough for that test, and digging in my brain for something I didn't put in there would have been a futile effort. Instead I turned in the test and spent the rest of the time thinking about other things. On a lighter note, he also taught an elective course titled \"Fun Science\" where he had us dissect frogs. He was going to dissect the other bag of frogs for our final exam. We were thinking we'd get some free time while he went to the science lab to get the frogs but he just opened his desk drawer and pulled out a bag of shriveled frogs that he had left in the desk drawer for 3 months. Needless to say, we didn't have a final exam and we all passed the course with flying colors as a result. I think there was a lesson there too, at the very least I definitely learned to put perishables in the refrigerator.",

He was not the \"fun\" teacher, but he also wasn't an asshole. He was serious, but for some reason, I felt that he had my interests at heart, and wasn't just collecting a pay cheque (like my grade 6 and 7 teachers). He assessed all the students math levels, and made a special group for about 6 of us, that were all in the same boat. He took the time with us out of the school day to go over multiplication and other match functions to make sure we understood it. He also spoke with my parents, and my dad (the ever super-patient man that he is) sat with me night after night and practiced... I liked the fun teacher, he was cool, but my Grade 5 teacher was the teacher in grade school that I respected the most.

Well, one day we were building little hot air balloons in class that were about eight feet tall. My group had finishing assembling ours and we wanted to make sure there weren't any holes in it. My teacher gave us an industrial powered hair dryer to inflate the ballon so we could check for leaks. I was at the bottom, holding the baloon, one girl was in charge of holding the hairdryer birthed from the core of a sun, and another girl was standing in a chair, holding the top of the balloon. Within a millisecond of the hairdryer making contact with the highly flammable paper, the hot air balloon went into flames. Imagine Hindenburg, but on a small scale, within a classroom. The girl on the chair that was holding the balloon immediately started screaming and I looked up to see her hair on fire. In a feat of unimaginable athleticism, my teacher/coach jumped 3 feet into the air, swooped the girl off the chair and had her under the emergency shower within 5 seconds. She didn't get burned at all except for her hair. We had to evacuate the building due to fire alarms, so everyone was pretty pumped. However, later that day at practice, I got an ass beating that I'll never forget from my teacher/coach lol.",

I remember writing big-ass full-page notes in my spiral saying \"You're good, don't sweat this\" and \"Slow down a bit\" trying to calm her down because she was obviously very flustered during the observation. She wound up passing with flying colors and pulled me aside after getting her review and hugged me saying my \"coaching\" gave her the confidence to show that she really was a good teacher. It really made my day to show a teacher that she was so awesome that she shouldn't have to be nervous for any reason. The second one was an English teacher my junior year. She had us doing an activity interpreting the \"linguistic color\" of a novel, and I suggested we try creating our own interpretation of the novel and (those that felt comfortable doing so) sharing our thoughts.

We all contributed quotes and memories, and we gave it to her to mark during the class. We also all brought in food, and as class ended we formed a kind of honour guard and made an arch with our arms for her to walk through and clapped her all the way to the staff room. We also bought her a massive mug for soup and/or beverages as a reminder for her to look after herself as well as others. We were all very sad to see her go, but we were also glad that we got to have her for as long as we did. There weren't many dry eyes by the end of that class.

We watched movies like The Devil Wears Prada and Inglorious Basterds. Sometimes we're allowed to dance on tables and listen to music, as long as it's not too loud. All of these teachers were pure awesomeness. Sure they taught us Catholic values, but it was mostly \"forgive people\" and \"love everyone no matter who they are\" and \"teach people to love, not to hate\". They taught a good sex ed as well. I hear tales from friends about how strict their religious educations were....yeah...we definitely weren't. We were definitely lucky.

I think he had a pedal as a switch too so it was super slick. He used it a couple of times too. We were going to calculate how high he could toss a wad of paper. He threw it up at the raised ceiling and waited to catch it. And waited, and waited, and then caught it with an elapsed time of like 9 seconds. That one was basically the same but he tossed the first wad through a ceiling tile.

But she was undeniably a fantastic teacher and an even better person. Let's call her Dr. B. Every Friday Dr. B would let the class ask her questions, and she would answer them. This ranged from what she was going to dress up as for Halloween to if she had ever smoked marijuana. Now, Dr. B was a breast cancer survivor, and every student knew this. She talked many times about how being sick had affected the way she lived her life. One Friday a student asked Dr. B what her greatest fear was, and of course she cast aside silly fears like the dark, spiders, and even death. Her answer was that her greatest fear was getting cancer again. Not because of the potential of dying, or even because of the unsavory effects of treatment. No, just because she didn't want to put her children through that. This answer led to me admiring her even more than I already did. And it made my heart break even harder when I saw on facebook this year that she had been diagnosed with cancer for the second time.",

I almost never saw someone leave her room not knowing the answer to their problem. And the student was always the one to figure it out, they were never handed the answer. She used to have one Friday a month set aside for discussion of any topic. Whatever you wanted to talk about in class. Didn't have to be school related. (until someone got uncomfortable when the topic turned to homosexuality by a few students, and administrators got involved. Whoever did that, fuck you. Those were the best days, because you got to hear so many different points of view you wouldn't normally get in school) If you had differing opinions to hers, she'd hear you out. A few times she told the person \"I'd never thought about it that way, you're right.\" and her opinions changed accordingly. She wasn't afraid to admit when she was wrong. She wrote a letter of recommendation for me to a college, and was a reference for my first two jobs. I went back to see her two years ago, and she was retiring after that year. Let me know her new address so I could stay in contact. Hands down, the best teacher I've ever met, and an all-around great person. ",

What she did really resonates with me and my willingness to push myself further and take risks comes from her. She's also responsible for community service activities in my school and she will always do whatever possible to help others in need. We were a private school, and the students are very privileged and well off, but she never let us forget to give back to those of us in need.

William Hockenhull was a legend long before I met him in 1976 and continued I imagine until the day he died. He was unconventional in the extreme. Examples include during a lesson on prehistory describing cavemen making knives and arrow heads from fling he was disgusted we didn't know what a bulb of percussion was so proceeded to drag the class to the car park where his car contained a ton of rocks and flint... an hour later we had all fashioned our own Paleolithic weapons which we took home and kept for years. A month later we were up to the Bronze Age and yep car park trip. He build a blast furnace out of a pile of bricks and a hand bellows and an hour later we had made an axe. But it didn't end there my favorite memory of my entire school career was a reenactment of the battle of Agincourt where we were driven by him in an ancient death trap of a coach to the moors and made pointy sticks then recreated the battle, lifting our 'pikes' from the filthy ground as he literally screamed and raced around giving instructions, 'the second charge occurs and again timing their reaction to perfection the English surprise the French with another row of PIKES!' Then 'FALL BACK' leaving the as yet hidden archers (28 kids throwing sticks) to merciless lay into their now bog ridden and trapped attackers. We didn't learn history from Bill and I doubt much of what we learned would ever be in an exam but we lived it which is even better. It's 40 years since I sat in his classroom but I still think of him whenever I watch a history doco. The world needs more teachers like him. He had a way of making people care about things they had no interest in. A lesson on Second World War artillery could swing off into calculus and firing tables in a heart beat, he had little care for who won battles or who started them - it was about the why and what was learned and how it made the world a better place. I think I'll watch some history tonight.",

Now, mind that he probably had the authority to destroy my shot at the honor roll, my conduct grade, and my permanent record... but he didn't. Instead, he said: \"Well, that's why God gave us brains to think and discover with.\" I shit you not, this moment could come straight from those \"and everybody clapped and he got the key to the city\" copypastas. You have to understand that prior to this, the school admin and faculty were very fundamentalist, or at least kept up that sort of appearance. Part of the requisite indoctrination process of kids was that they be rendered completely obedient and docile... and here was an actual pastor, telling us to use our heads instead of GOING TO THE OFFICE RIGHT NOW DO YOU HEAR ME?!?!?! He was different, and that moment was only the first sign. He became one of the most universally loved and respected faculty members in his short tenure as a teacher. Between him and our young and upstart Literature teacher (whom I might cover separately should I feel so inclined), the couple of years spent with them felt like the first time we (as a batch) opened our eyes and our minds to critical thinking. It was fucking magical. Pastor G.S., you rock. \\* (nah just kidding, i wasn't really an edgelord, but this moment probably counts as an edgelord moment)",

It stands for Evil Little Fat man.\" That comment endeared him to me straight away. My thirteen year old mind thought it was hilarious. In terms of taking no shit, we had a kid in class (isn't there always one?) who would regularly dick about. Now, one day, he did something bad, I think he hit another kid. Normally, teachers would chew him out then and there, gaining him the attention and notoriety some kids think is really important. Not Mr Ison. He just quietly came over, sent him out of the room, down the corridor to the office. He was out of sight of the classroom, which had a big ass window next to the door. After about five minutes, during which he gave us work to do, he calmly went out, down the corridor, to the office, and then there was an explosion. We could hear him yelling all the way down to the classroom. It was epic, and that kid never played up in his class again. Another one, Mr Shreeve, was my GCSE/A Level teacher. He was young, skinny, and hilarious. He spoke to us like adults, and had a great way of teaching. He made it fun, interactive, and would occasionally act for us in the context of teaching us something. Each year we got older, the more he's swear, saying that the more we grew up, the more he felt comfortable doing that because we were adults. He told us a story one time, about how he was frightened of badgers. I don't know if he is actually scared of them for real, but it sounded convincing. Apparently he made the mistake of charging a badger to scare it away from the chicken coop, and everyone knows that's a daft idea. So, we as a class thought it would be fun to play the badger song on the projector when he left the room. Lols were had. There are loads of other stories about these two but I think I've gone on way long enough.",

He is a VERY emotionally stoic man, he rarely shows emotion so I was just expecting him to walk out and get someone else to deal with me. Except he didn't, he sat right next to me as I balled my eyes out, he hugged his knees and stayed with me until I stopped crying. After I stopped crying I eventually apologized for being unprofessional but he just told me to keep crying if I needed to. He knew exactly what I was going through due to me talking to the provided counsellor. He told me that life is extremely hard but no matter what I have to keep going. He told me it's okay to give up sometimes but I should never give up on myself. He kept reassuring me that he was proud of me and everything that I've accomplished as a dancer and as an artist especially at such a young age. He taught me the discipline to never give up on myself and I am forever grateful for that.",

My teacher Mrs. Toevs was on the younger side and she was incredibly sweet to my whole class. Not a day went by where someone didn't hug her at least once. She planned a couple field trips for us, one was for laser tag and the other was to a roller rink. My mom was a single mom at that point, working as a nurse during the days so she could see us at night. I didn't have a ride to the roller rink because my mom was still at work, so Mrs. Toevs drove me to the rink herself and spent the whole time holding my hand and helping me skate. I was completely at ease and she was so nice to me. I'm about her age now when she was my teacher, and it's still such an important memory for me. Some teachers go above and beyond. ",

I'll always remember her last words to me: \"If you ever need anything (I would be continuing on to university in the Spring), shoot me an e-mail. I'll miss you.\" \"I'll miss you, too,\" I said.

I've seen him doing countless selfless things that at the time I thought was cool for a math teacher, but today I realize how incredible the guy was * Offered free weekend classes to anyone willing. He'd invite a few of us at his place, give us advices and everything, and best part was his wife would make us dinner and wouldn't accept we leave before eating it haha. Eventually everyone wanted to go just for the food because Moroccan food is superb. I'm of Algerian descent myself and they felt like family. It just felt like I was visiting an uncle or something. (before any ill-intended American redditor comes at me: this was in France, a country where an adult talking to a kid doesn't immediately scream pedophile) * Spotted the few kids who were from a very poor family and would put extra effort towards helping them. Invited them to join him for lunch and he always had extra sandwiches or stuff for them. He told us he asked his wife if she could make some extra to make sure no one in school ever has to skip lunch. Asked that if any of us is in need or knows someone in need, we should ask him. Well in fact some kids took advantage of this, but he obviously knew, and didn't mind. It felt like... He just wanted to share something with kids * He honestly wasn't a rich guy at all, but didn't care about making more money. He loved sharing knowledge and teaching kids. Often told us how he was from a very poor Moroccan village and somehow made it. He'd run \"wagers\" with students. \"If you can solve that exercise for next time I'll give you 10EUR\". Well I can tell you people would work extra hard. 10 euros for a 12 year old poor kid was a fortune. I used to do an equivalent of spelling bees and got qualified to the regional finals which were a two-hour drive away. My parents couldn't help me for that. My math teacher actually took me there (note: at this point he was closer to us. My mom invited him and his wife for lunch a couple of times lol). I unfortunately didn't do well but to this day I can't believe you'd do that * I remember once, he helped one of the... \"troubled kids\" in my class. He was this kind of kid staying outside at all times, frequenting thugs etc. A common thing in the neighborhood was drug dealers would ask kids to run errands for them, because cops don't really check 12 years old kids - and you can give \u20ac10 to the kid and he'll be happy about it, right? Well this kid got caught once. And he told the police that... the math teacher was his dad. Too scared of his parents' reaction I guess. Teacher went to the police station to pick him up. He called the kid's parents to join him but they were \"busy\" and basically signed something for him to be legally allowed to pick the kid up. He did, and personally took him home, talked to his parents etc. This kid was never the same again. He saw more than a teacher, he saw someone who was ready to go through all efforts to make sure his life gets better. He became way more serious at school, started getting good grades, avoided the street etc. What a teacher. I don't think I've ever met someone remotely as genuinely interested in helping kids as this guy. I wish I could see him again some day",

For someone to have so much passion for a subject like english or science that they want to teach it they are definitely going to be a bit nerdy about it too. I feel for the teachers who were a little 'too eccentric' though. We had this one teacher in high school who was very outspoken and a little odd at times. It also didn't help that she was this little 5\" tall pudgy woman with frizzy hair and thick round glasses. In grade 9 I heard a bunch of rumors of her freaking out on students here and there in the past, with the most notable being that she threw a chair at a student. But when I finally had her, I realized she was just very eccentric and so a lot of students didn't take her seriously, so they would provoke her and disregard her authority more than any other, which would of course make her visibly frustrated, which would make the shitheads do it more. I also learned that she had just gone through a divorce with one of the other teachers, and so all of the stress from that was understandably getting compounded with the shit she got from students. Hell seeing the way some students treated her I probably would have thrown a chair if I were her too.",

One example was before one of my teachers came into the classroom, one of the more dumb kids thought it would be funny to draw a giant penis across the entire chalkboard (like 30 feet long). The teacher walks in, just erases the only part of the penis to write down what he needs for his lesson and goes on to each class. Doesn't even mention that there is a giant penis on the board for the whole class period. I guess he figured there was no reason to make it an issue if it didn't need to be one. Mad respect.",

I remember only 2 other groups actually finished their video, and when we presented ours the whole class was laughing their ass off including the teacher. We actually ended up including some relatively raunchy shit, but he didn't get us in trouble for it and asked if we could make a more 'appropriate' cut of it so he could show the teachers during one of their meetings. Unfortunately, the principal found the other version, which we had uploaded to YouTube, and was not happy with us. He made me sign into my YT account in his office and delete it because it 'represented the school wrong' even though there was literately nothing in the video or description that referenced it being a school project. Anyway, I could go on about that for ages. I kind of hated that principal, but it was great to have a creatively nourishing teacher. I ended up just [reuploading the video like a month later anyway...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiBrBMuXVLM)",

No dumb words like dumb, but don't over embellish with words. **Remove passive voice from all of your writing**. Instead of saying \"the ball was thrown by Billy\" just say that Billy threw the ball. It decreases wordiness and helps flow. This is biggest thing I learned, and it's certainly not easy. Microsoft Word has options under its proof reader to look for passive voice. Structure. Is this actually needed? What is the purpose of each paragraph and each sentence in the paragraphs. You'll be surprised how useless some shit is. It also helps against redundancy. Be concise. You generally won't have ridiculous word limits so you don't need to over emphasize or elaborate too much on shit. Get what you want to say onto the page. Make it make sense. Have someone read it. Do I need to say more about that? Also, don't be afraid to destroy and have to completely rewrite what you were working on. A good paper has more in common with a work of art. It needs to be worked on, molded, an adapted before it's a finished piece. Source: in college and took a year of writing classes",

Even more than that, the teacher picks up from a point halfway through the novel as if the class had been about WH all along. You *know* this is wrong but the teacher still goes on about WH; you try to tell him that you'd spent the past several weeks reading about 1984 (not WH) but he says he doesn't know what you're talking about, you've all been reading about WH. That is what OP is getting at: the teacher is illustrating this point (which is an integral part of understanding 1984) by performing it in class. Perhaps the most famous espousal of this in the book is \"Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.\" That is, how the party changed allegiances and enemies and then maintained that they had always been that way. Everyone *knows* that it wasn't always this way, but they are so scared to speak out about that they stay silent and go along with the deception.",

We never really disrupted class, we always paid attention, we contributed thoughtful and meaningful discussion when asked to, and consistently scored well enough on AP and IB exams for the teachers to get a bonus check. I can't think of many parents that would complain unless the teacher was truly being unfair and failed a majority of the class. The one teacher who was frequently reported was my IB Pre-Calc teacher in 10th grade. He was a new guy, expected way too much from us since we were supposedly the \"brightest kids in the county,\" and was just filled with disappointment when he learned that we weren't absorbing his information. The sad thing is that he, like you mentioned, had all these fresh and new ideas to get his students engaged and learning, but I guess it just never went off for him since he wasn't exactly the best teacher. He eventually got fired and I felt really bad for him :/ though it made me feel better that this was just his retirement job and he was only in it because he loved teaching. However, many of the dedicated teachers there have been there for decades (despite having Masters or Ph.Ds in marketable fields), and one of them even taught my friend's parents. But there's a negative side as well. My school has a separate IB program that mainly attracts wealthier kids with privileged backgrounds from the other side of town, while the regular \"Major Program\" is filled with hundreds of disadvantaged Black kids from the Ghetto. Our school published statistics and about 72% of the students live in poverty, and a large amount of those students fill up these statistics. In fact, the only reason why the IB program was put in this school in particular was because it was doing so poorly that it almost shut down until an IB program was installed and its ratings skyrocketed over the next 30 years. No one really wants to say anything, but the major program teachers definitely have it worse. My IB Biology teacher taught 2 major program classes, and one day when I stayed over to do a lab, I noticed that they were probably the most ill-behaved kids I've ever seen. They were ignoring the teacher, talking in class, and playing with their phones. I could tell that my teacher had basically given up with that class and just put random biology videos on for them to watch, which was opposed to the enthusiasm and activeness she showed when she taught her IB students. On the other side of the hall, we always heard the HL IB Chemistry teacher screaming at her misbehaved major program class as they continued rambling. The AP/IB teachers are paid more than the regular students according to one of my teachers, and as a result a lot of the major program teachers end up leaving after a few years since I'm assuming they don't want to put up with the disrespect and low pay. Even then, the IB teachers aren't exactly paid the best salary and occasionally we have teachers leave for better opportunities. I know this goes a bit off topic but my school basically shows how screwed up the education system is. Most of the schools' resources and funding went towards the IB kids, and we even received personal MacBooks when pretty much all of us had a few computers back at home, as opposed to some Major Program kids who didn't even have Internet access or food when they returned home. I feel as if most Major Program teachers hate their job there seeing as most quit after a few years. It's a never-ending cycle. The kids are most likely misbehaving because they were subject to bad influences growing up, and as a result they come into class unmotivated and uncaring, which angers and demoralizes the teachers, and in turn he/she doesn't put as much effort into helping these kids. Most of these kids go to a local community college or directly into the workforce after graduating, whereas ALL of the IB kids go to a university, and at least the top 10-20% of the IB class ends up going to an Ivy League or highly ranked school, whereas the rest attend top-50 universities. Due to the advantages that the IB kids have, there's still a lot of de facto segregation and discrimination at my school. Both programs don't really interact with each other, and IB kids tend to make jokes about the Major Programs' disadvantages. It doesn't even extend to the students, as there was a substitute-teacher that trash talked the Major Program kids and loudly voiced his opinions of how \"dumb those kids are.\" (He didn't get fired since nobody reported him). A few years ago my school tried implementing this integration program to help connect the IB with the Major Program, but it failed horribly since like I said before, nobody wanted to interact and IB kids remained with IB kids and MP remained with MP.

The example I use is, \"The school was built last year.\" What are you going to say? \"They built the school last year?\" Who the hell is \"they?\" Do we even give a shit? No! Get that shit out of here and use passive. We're introducing more crap we have to explain that we actually don't care one whit about, and we can avoid all that headache with passive. Newspapers frequently use passive when focused on, say, a recent accomplishment of a team of, say, scientists. You want the focus to be on the accomplishment (let's use the LHC). A lot of sentences can use active voice, but some - such as when it was constructed - basically require passive voice (LHCs don't build themselves, y'know). In an article all about the LHC, \"Scientists and engineers built the LHC in (year)\" feels out of place. Also, as a linguist(ish), there's literally no reason to ever believe that a distinct feature of a language should be avoided (and passive voice again).",

In my country college is free but you in order to enter one every student must pass exams. There are 3 different \"paths\" you can go in high school each having different exams (physics-maths-cs, chemistry-biology-maths, literature-etc-etc). Depending on the exams you can apply to different colleges. Each college accepts a certain number of students each year. For example my college for the computer science department accepted the year i entered 120 students. The top 120 students that applied for the college got in. Its highly competitive and rarely do people go to colleges they dont want or that the drop out of. All in all this is a highly effective system. Everyone who is determined and hardworking can get college education for 0 cost, not even textbooks. The students in each class want to be there and have very good base knowledge due to the competitive nature of the exams. Well at least for the mid to high end class colleges. Lower end colleges to be easier and of lower standard but offer a good degree and knowledge non the less. This system is by no means perfect but is a very good standard in my opinion. Everyone has a chance with no money or anything else needed. Plus free education raises society's educational level which is always a good thing",

TL;DR: university is free, but they filter the shit out of you to make sure you won't waste resources. \\* Edit: Of course, your high school GPA matters, the higher it is, the more likely you are to be able to apply to the school of your choice. Public university is free and the education was really good, people whose GPA wasn't good enough could still apply, but wouldn't probably make it. People with higher GPAs had preference. There were still private universities that of course had a tuition that needed to be paid, and even then, The government offered to subsidized your education.

Making college free would simply lure an even greater number of marginal students into that trap.

To put it in perspective, this is a little more than the cost the U.S. [spent on food stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program) last year. 2) **Many students who attend college never complete it.** For example, nearly [4 in 10 students](https://www.brookings.edu/research/should-policymakers-make-college-free-or-better-support-institutions/) at public four year colleges do not graduate. Of course, part of these low graduation rates might be costs. However, the sad reality is still that many students enter college educationally and socially underprepared. Free college won't change that, and that means that taxpayers will be footing the bill for students who will never graduate. 3) **It's essentially a redistribution of money to wealthy and middle class kids.** Ask yourself who the most likely people to attend college are. The answer, of course, are kids from families who are already pretty well off. Universal free college is ultimately un-progressive, because it would [disproportionately benefit those at the top half of the income distribution.](https://www.brookings.edu/research/who-would-benefit-most-from-free-college/) Of course, there are also reasons why free college may be good public policy which I have left uncovered -- I myself am torn on the issue. However, I hope I have highlighted some of the arguments to keep a healthy skepticism of it. ",

Therefore, if colleges can't use higher tuition as a means of deterring applicants they will make academic requirements far higher. That means that the average applicant will have to spend more time studying (and not working) to be admitted. If you're from a wealthy family, that isn't a huge problem. But if you're from a poorer family and you have to work to put food on the table, you might not be able to devote more time to studying. Granted high tuitions aren't exactly good for the poor either, but under the current system they can take on debt to go to school. If it were free, many likely wouldn't be admitted at all. ",

Compare the average college student with the 1954 8th Grade Civics Test (below).

I believe the discussion of the cost of college or university is a loss leader. If our regular schools, that are largely funded by tax dollars, were set up to exceed the current expectations then the skill of the students leaving them would be as good or better than those we are currently graduation from our universities. The decline of public education also raises the question of how our university education would fare under a fully government (taxpayer) funded situation. Nobody wants to live in government housing if they can help it. Nobody enjoys the long wait at the DMV. Why should taking our education further in the direction of government control give us any reason to expect excellence? http://www.rense.com/general75/pass.htm One other point.

People get bogus degrees, and areas that could actually use more people (the trades) are suffering for it, for no good reason but the fact that they require a different form of certification. The current system is blatantly wasting taxpayer money. Personally, I don't believe services should be taxpayer funded at all, but even if you do believe in taxpayer funded services, you recognize the issues with being forced to fund the lowest value of degrees while being deprived of the services you actually need *because* of it. Plus, what's going to happen when nobody can repay these loans, because they're working at Starbucks or McDonald's for the rest of their lives? If the market is more privatized, the institutions that offer worthless degrees will quickly go out of business, while the ones that offer good degrees will stay in business. Students who can't afford it on their own will have much better options in scholarships and private loans, as the public loan system goes out of business. There will be a better controlled market for what degrees are offered in and how many of those degrees are offered, such that the market isn't flooded in any one area, and will also help with saturation in areas that people previously didn't explore, but would because of the new system requiring them to consider alternative options.",

In Australia university used to be free and now you have a loan through the government that gets taken out of your pay like tax once you've met a threshold earning level. Access to education should be based on academic merit not wealth. So making education affordable doesn't mean take every student who thinks \"yeah why not\". We still have limits on places and for the most desirable subjects it is very difficult to get in. By limiting the places you aren't faced with issues of oversupply. In terms of people enrolling in education who shouldn't be there, having minimum requirements prevents this BUT there will always be people who hate school and end up not pursuing tertiary education, or who are hands on and pursue a trade. So does this mean the reasons not to make it free/govt subsidised are \"I didn't get/need this opportunity so why should others access it\" and/or \"I'm wealthy enough that this isn't my problem, fuck you poor people\"?",

I'm 21 now and working for a company that very rarely brings in people right out of college. People no longer care about the degree. It means nothing anymore. In European countries, where it is free, the culture is very different. In America, college is now an experience. You see that through the college culture here. It's not about learning because the average student spends only 3.5 hours a day on studies (and that is probably exaggerated source : https://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/students.htm). That coupled with grade inflation, makes college now a joke. Even the Ivy leagues are becoming somewhat of a joke. (http://www.tcrecord.org/content.asp?contentid=16473). Am I saying that college kids need to work 12 hours a day, never party, and work 3 jobs? No. But if you want to argue for socialized education, you can't ignore the fact that our acceptance rates would NEED to be cut.

EDIT: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_326.10.asp Great statistics from the National Center for Educational Statistics. While my initial number of 80% was wrong, it was not wrong by much. Go through these numbers and take a look at Public Institions. For 1996-2008, we had 26-34% of students actually graduating. Let me briefly give you an explanation of that so you can understand what these numbers actually mean. For an example I'll use my public community college, it's about $25,000 for a four year degree. We've got about 13,000 students on campus. To send all those people to school for 4 years for a bachelors, which let's face it, is more likely to be 5 years (we'll go with 4), comes out to $325,000,000. Let's take the average graduation rate of years 96-08 public instition rates and we get 31%. Now let's fast forward a bit. We'll imagine if out of those 13,000 students that 4,030 graduate (31%) and the rest (69%) dropped out. If we have some fun with math, we can say that it took $325 million to get those 4,030 kids through school. That would put them to the tune of $80,645 per degree. Now we've spent 322.58% more money to get those people an education. In reality though, what we did was waste $223 million dollars on those 8,920 students that did not complete school. Now these numbers are just for my local community college and assuming that nobody transfers. This doesn't account for books, it does not account for tacked on fees that the colleges get us for, and it does not count for the campuses that do provide dorms. Even though we don't know those figures, we do know that spending $325 million dollars to educate roughly 4,000 adults is a lot of money. It's not practical to see every single person going to college unless you tax the people into the stone ages. My question to you: Is it worth it? ",

I don't want to fund a gamble we know we will be losing out of the gate and I doubt others do either. I would be down with a free college system that gives incentives to educational paths directed at filling much needed positions and reduces the incentives for majors with projected career paths into a flooded job market. Also, require students to have passing grades. As it stands, you need to be on academic probation to lose out on financial aid at a City College level.

There's nothing wrong with either path, but as it stands right now, all of our eggs are in one basket.

Yes, some high schools - the ones where more affluent students went - had more challenging curricula than today; I've looked at my parents and grandparents transcripts. The curriculum was harder because by the time you got to 11th grade, mostly only the college-bound or skilled-trade bound were left. The rest had dropped out. As a result, high schools could teach Latin. > Today we graduate 9 of 10 white students and a little less than 7 of 10 minority students. The black graduation rate, in particular, has skyrocketed from what it was. > It's true that U.S. educational outcomes have stagnated since the early to mid 1970s. They haven't gone down, but they just haven't gotten better. The 1970s was also the post-civil rights era when most minority and/or poor children started staying in school instead of dropping out at age 14-17 to go to work. ",

They have no intention of using those skills, but they do like having the classes paid for and collecting a few thousand in grant money every semester. Source: I did this for a couple semesters and got paid to go to school taking classes that were essentially filler, but I would have lost financial aid if I did not take them. I would have much rather received reduced financial aid and not have taken 9 units of classes that were pass/fail, but unfortunately the FAFSA system is outdated and it is usually an all or none scenario. My choices were: lose all my financial aid or take a couple fun but pointless classes and get $4,000/semester. What would you have done?",

As circular as it sounds, the value of a degree is determined by the value of the skills it teaches you to the marketplace.

And certainly the difficulty of the degree helps reduce the number of graduates, which pushes up the value, but it is not the only factor involved. If NASA were eliminated tomorrow, or if disease wiped out 90% of the population, rocket science would be just as hard of a degree, but it would become much less valuable to the marketplace and would earn much less. Another example is computer science (which I majored in). I would say that computer science is about equally difficult to other engineering degrees. (It might even be slightly easier than other engineering degrees). But a computer science degree commands more money in the marketplace than (most) other engineering degrees. Why? Because the software industry is much younger than civil engineering or aerospace (especially in it's recent forms). It is still experiencing growth far beyond the other engineering disciplines. (All this is for now of course). My bet is that in 50 years, a computer science degree will be worth about the same or perhaps a little less than other engineering degrees.",

However I know people who were in situations where it wasn't even practical for them to finish high school. The moment they were old enough to work they did. This isn't really how you get ahead in life, but they didn't really have a choice. To them a 'free' college is an expense benefiting only those wealthy enough to actually take advantage of it. I don't mean to say impoverished people benefit from a higher barrier of entry into college (because they don't) just that it's a little bit more complicated than 'free school'.

There's no downward pressure, there's no mix of private and subsidized loans a student won't sign. 3) This was all well and good when state school systems were well-funded but pinched and increasingly conservative legislatures have been axing those budgets to the bone. This exerts further upward pressure. 4) Competing for this free money and talented (and full-pay students), private universities have been turning their campuses into playgrounds, which puts pressure on public universities to follow suit. Further upward pressure. Frame the debate not as \"I should go to college without paying\" but \"I am willing to pay higher taxes so that there is a pathway for qualified people who do not have social or economic capital to achieve their potential. As I depend on these people, whether I have children or not, to fund my social security and medicaid, it seems reasonable that we have at least one reverse pyramid scheme\" Maybe some blend of the following: A) Replace the taxpayer backstop on student loans with a shall-issue ~$10K/yr voucher. To receive these vouchers, schools must pass accreditation standards and cap tuition for all students at, say, $15,000/year (downward pressure) B) End un-dischargability of student debt to restrict credit and induce further downward pressure C) A downside of the capped tuition and restricted credit is that schools will need to cut nice-to-haves, like state-of-the-art dining halls and residence halls. You're 18, you can sleep two-to-a-room and slum it a bit. That's your side of the trade-off. Undergraduate facilities are fucking insane. D) Service requirement for using the voucher for students. Think GI bill. 1 year pre, 1 year-equivalent post. End the system of young-adult-day-care currently in place. Everyone I know who was out in the world for a year before matriculating took a very, very different approach to school and crushed it. E) I do not think it appropriate to limit to STEM, etc. There's already plenty of incentive to go into those fields for those who are capable, and Finance will siphon off the difference makers anyway.

You can get a lot of grants/scholarships even when starting from scratch with zero academic background, especially where i am in Massachusetts. I'd seriously recommend going to your local community college and talking with an adviser. You'd most likely get your classes for free assuming you can pass them. Start off slow, and take your time. Obviously the state/school aren't going to pay your rent or utilities, but community college won't burden you and can earn you a free ride to a 4 year school.

I love learning. i love the feeling that comes with knowing things. but it's not hard to see that large swaths of the school system are utter bullshit. a lot of the time i get the feeling that when people excel, they're doing it in spite of the system rather than because of it. but you didn't come to me to ask about politics, you came to ask about how the hell to survive school. well i can only speak personally, but i'm the sort of person who would have learned things whether i was in school or not. i taught myself how to use DAWs and the basics of sound synthesis. i taught myself photoshop. animation. how carburetors work. i've always been trying to learn things, so for me, i was able to look at university as a way for me to get easy knowledge. after all, you just sit your ass down in lecture and they hand that shit out! it was great! **while i hated the system itself, i liked what i managed to take from it** that's really what it boils down to. i wasn't staying in college because i had made friends i liked, i wasn't staying there because of a fraternity or sports team, *i stayed there because college put me in proximity to experts whose knowledge i wanted to have*. and let me be honest, it sucked. at times it *really* sucked. i'm not one of those people who looks back on his college days and glows in effervescent reminiscence. i made it through college because i could learn things quickly there and i liked how it felt to learn and know things. that was my motivation. it helped that my majors were two fields i wanted to know *just to know them*. i didn't have an end-game for most of my college career. i wasn't going to uni \"to become\" something, i was there just \"to learn\" something. if that makes sense. so just the simple act of being there was enough to start fulfilling the goals i had for going there in the first place. it wasn't, \"i'm going here to be a translator, and i can do that in four years,\" it was, \"I'm going here to learn Japanese, and *i'm doing that right now.*\" honestly i think that instant process-based fulfillment was a large part of what helped keep me there. but maybe that won't work for you. in fact, i'd hazard a guess that it probably won't. you seem to have gone in with a specific endgame in mind. you seem to have gone in to college \"to become\" something. so capitalize on that. trade on knowledge-futures, if you will. find out what topics you need to learn to become the kind of engineer you're aiming for (do you need to know fluid dynamics? what about CAD? Chip architecture?). make a checklist of that shit, check off the stuff you've learned, add bonus checkboxes for mastery of a topic. you're an engineer, you know math; calculate how long until you're outta there and make a countdown calendar. anything to remind yourself that you are becoming more of an engineer day by day and soon, soon enough, these days of forcing yourself to class will be behind you. in other words, do everything you can to make it about the process, not the endgame. hope that helps.",

That just makes poor folks stuck without a degree and not being able to do jobs that require a degree! I'm not saying there isn't a problem, but this isn't the way to fix this. On that note, the value of a degree is certainly NOT about how much someone paid, but about whether said person can do his job. If someone graduates with a medical degree, it doesn't matter how much he paid for college if he can't treat my illness. He should only be allowed to be a doctor if he can do his job.

(And this also limits the weird rash of college seniors trying to remember to take their math credit over the summer just to graduate, or being told in their last semester OH WAIT YOU NEED 1 MORE HOUR OF SCIENCE EVEN THO WE DON'T OFFER IT IN ONE HOUR CREDITS and all be other degree planning hiccups.) Entry level jobs which never care about your degree type (just it's existence proving you have the kind of real world experience that limits the amount of training and handholding the company has to do with each employee and gaurantees a basic skill level) could then only require this new AGS degree as the baseline meaning we still have an educated workforce. Then Bachelors and above count as either additional experience or qualify you for higher-than-entry level positions - which is a hurdle millennials are fighting right now. Even just the experience of meeting new people and having to mature enough to handle those first two years make a huge difference in preparing people to be citizens of the world, and would be beneficial to everyone - not just the students.
