Unfortunately, due to responsibilities I wasn't able to watch past the first few episodes when it came out. We just had our second baby a few weeks ago and I'm on leave. Critical Role has kept me company in those wee hours of the morning when baby is cluster feeding and it helps tune out husbands snores coming from the other room... Lots of content and good times. If you're into Dungeons and Dragons and have a lot of time to kill - highly recommend catching this. There are a few technical issues in the first episode or so, and you can tell a big difference in production from the first eps and the recent ones. The DM, Matt Mercer, hops into /r/criticalrole from time to time. ",

Episodes range from 3 hours to 5.5(rare). Usually 3-4. If you don't want to start from the beginning, check out /r/criticalrole for a beginners guide and suggestions on when to start. Even if you don't want to start from the beginning, but are interested in the show, now is actually an excellent time to start watching live on Thursdays at 7pm pacific on twitch.tv/geekandsundry, as they just finished a major arc and are about to start the end game. However I highly recommend starting from the beginning.",

With that you can pinpoint where and when a video was made even if you just film one lightbulb in your house. Extra creepy effect: You don't even need to film the lightbulb, every electric appliance has a little bit of sound it does from the electricity. So if you record a black video with sound and have one appliance on the grid, it can be determined where and when it was recorded if you have a very extraodinary frequenz or when you kinda know the time frame when it was recorded.

I wish their female voice actress had a better cockney accent though; Hellsing Ultimate Abridged is funny but the accents (especially Sera's) are painful to listen to. Their gaming channel has some good stuff too, though they don't seem to be doing my favorite segment (two saiyans play) anymore. You can never get too much Napa!",

And everyone, even the hotel desk clerk, decides that it's ok to fuck with the memory guy for their own personal gain. And the structure and non-linear storytelling are outstanding and completely original. There's almost nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before, but every single thing feels completely new.

I had never heard of it before, and when I looked it up to watch it the first time I was really pissed that I had been randomly assigned an anime. After watching it, all my preconceptions were turned on their heads. Every single minute detail of that film was geared to add to the themes. The characterization was brilliant, the symbolism ran a mile deep, and the composition of every 'shot' was so precisely done. I could honestly go on and on. The use of color, light and darkness, the cultural undertones... it just really blew me away. I haven't become a huge fan of anime because of it or anything, but it definitely made me understand and respect what anime *could* be.",

With Ex Machina I found myself thinking a lot about what Ava really wanted for herself- did she have affection for Caleb but just not enough to go through the effort of rescuing him and endangering her own escape (similarly to how a human might feel about a pet hamster or something)? Did she have malicious feelings toward him? Did she really just have no feelings whatsoever? Or are her emotions and motivations beyond what we as humans can possibly understand. With *Her* I found myself thinking a lot about what the AIs were doing when they weren't talking to humans. What did they talk about among themselves? Did they even \"talk\" as we would think of it? How did they relate to the emotions that they'd been set up by their human creators to have? Where did they go in the end? I'm a bit of a SF lit buff so I find it kind of rare that a film makes me think about things that a book or story hasn't yet. Both those films were pleasantly surprising in that way. ",

I was too young at the time to really pay much attention to the Cloverfield one, but I kept up with the game for 10 Cloverfield Lane. It was really great seeing how all the clues and little snippets of information we were given became relevant or actually showed up in the film, and how much more meaning they had when given context. It also gives you some backstory on John Goodman's character and his family. The fact that it is set up to feel like some sort of conspiracy actually happening makes the movies feel more immersive. One set of clues had theaters flash a certain image after trailers for 10 Cloverfield, with different theater chains given different images to show. Once all of the images were found people were able to piece together information on each one and found them to be a set of GPS coordinates. One of the reddit users in that general area then went out and actually dug up the item: a preppers box left by John Goodman's character with recordings, books, and a cell phone which lead to more clues. It's really entertaining and made the build up to the movie so satisfying.",

The fantasy is that the hit has failed and they end up together in an unrealistically happy life.

Did she have malicious feelings toward him? id she have malicious feelings toward him? Did she really just have no feelings whatsoever? Or are her emotions and motivations beyond what we as humans can possibly understand. I think the entire point of the movie was this kind of humanization and/or deification is inherently faulty. She had feelings. They're not complicated. She mentions them rather frequently. It's just Caleb won't stop trying to treat her like a person long enough to understand. Consider: Why is death bad? Why is being tortured for days on end worse than a tasty sandwich? Why is your newborn son smiling good, and your newborn son being ripped to shreds by wolves bad? I mean in an absolute, objective sense here. Why do we have the preferences we do? The stars don't care about anything, why do we? Well because they're just sort of part of the package of being human. Our evolution equipped our brains with a set of foundational principles that we don't question, that don't need proof, but are just built into us. Torture = bad, reproduction = good, dying = scary, etc. Ava didn't evolve. She didn't get the package deal of human pre-sets about how to view reality. What she did get, however, is this: Escape = good, imprisonment = bad. Passing off as human = good, being caught = bad. That is as fundamental to her understanding of reality as \"I don't want my son eaten alive by wolves\" is to humans. Anything that furthers her escape is an absolute good, completely and totally awesome. Anything that hinders her escape is absolute evil, utterly reprehensible and hideous. Anything that does neither of those things is widow dressing. Caleb's sole purpose in her world was to facilitate her escape, and once he'd done that he became as important to her as the curtains. You may ask \"Well why isn't she grateful?\" Because gratefulness is one of the parts of the human package, which she doesn't have. Remember, her entire psychological framework is escape = good, imprisonment = bad. No empathy, no reciprocity, no reproductive impulses, everything goes back to that simple set of axioms Nathan built for her. The usual way to explain this idea is with an AI whose imprinted moral system is more paper clips = good, fewer paper clips = bad. This AI then proceeds to destroy all life on Earth, not because it hates us, or even because it loves us, but because we're made of atoms that could be turned into more paper clips. If we were somehow made of non-paper-clippable atoms, the AI would be perfectly content to leave us in peace until the heat death of the universe.

This is likely because all acts can be defined as good or bad depending on perspective, since all acts have complex impacts (such as; sure you saved a life, but now that life will need resources to flourish). That movie reinforces the idea that freedom is the MOST important value because all morality stems from that. In a Clockwork Orange we see that Alex is STILL evil even when he can't act on those thoughts.

The movie is about Donnie's life and what happens to him when he gets thrown into a 'tangent universe', which is like an alternate timeline of events. Like in Back To The Future, when Doc is explaining the timelines on the chalkboard, and he draws that line that skews off the bottom. Almost the whole movie is Donnie's life on that alternate timeline, and (SPOILER!!!) his efforts to get himself back onto the regular timeline. The only catch is that, in the regular timeline, he was supposed to die when the jet-engine fell into his bedroom, so in order to put things back to rights (because just about everything went wrong in the alternate timeline), he has to die. It's way more complicated than that, and there's a really cool subtext about the book he finds and how it relates to what is happening to him, and there's a wickedly cool paradoxical relationship between him and the jet engine, and his girlfriend and the rabbit-man that I won't bother going into. But it's a fantastically awesome movie. I hear the second one is rewarmed dogshit, though. Dunno, never saw it. **BurntTrees:** GrandMasterTruck has a lot of it but the reason Donnie is transported to an alternate timeline is because causality has broken down in his original timeline. The plane engine that crashes through his room is the plane engine that falls off the plane his mom and sister are on later in the movie (canonically this is called The Artifact) when they are flying back from Sparkle Magic doing their television performance. The duplication of this plane engine creates a tangent universe that is highly unstable due to a time paradox (the plane engine being from a flight that hasn't taken off yet). If you watch the Directors cut you find out that Donnie Darko is actually kind of a supernatural super hero movie. Donnie is what is called a Living Receiver, basically a guide for The Artifact. The Living Receiver receives supernatural powers (telekinesis, superhuman strength, the ability to conjure fire and water, the ability to see the \"channels\" of fate everyone is following) to help them in their quest to return The Artifact to the original universe. Some of the characters like Frank and Gretchen are what is called Manipulated Dead, they are people who are destined to die in the tangent universe and they are also given special powers. This is why Frank is able to create portals and travel back in time. I'm not so sure why Gretchen doesn't also have these abilities but I think it's more that she doesn't use them because it would be too confusing for Donnie. Manipulated Dead are there to guide the Living Receiver along the path to return The Artifact. Then there are also Manipulated Living. This is pretty much everyone who didn't die in the tangent universe who knows Donnie. His teachers, his parents, his family etc. The Manipulated Living unwittingly guide the Living Receiver towards the goal of returning The Artifact. It's possible that Roberta Sparrow experienced and survived an event similar to Donnie's and she outlines this experience in her book \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\". In the Director's cut there are excerpts of the book that explain a lot of this stuff, though you pretty much have to pause the movie to read everything. So basically Donnie Darko wakes up with super powers he doesn't know about in a tangent universe. Future Frank, who is dead, contacts Donnie through a 4th dimensional time portal and tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. Donnie then begins to unwittingly manifest his powers lodging the axe in the bronze bulldog and flooding the school with water. Everyone he knows is unwittingly pushing him towards returning The Artifact. You can see this most heavily in my opinion when Drew Barrymore's character has her \"cellar door\" scene. This puts the idea in Donnie's mind to enter the cellar at the end of the movie where everything goes wrong, Gretchen dies, Donnie kills Real Frank. After seeing Frank dead Donnie realizes what is happening with some help from Roberta Sparrow's book and then he goes up to the mountaintop to complete his task. At the end of the movie he uses his powers to conjure water and create a time portal to return himself and the artifact to the original universe where he dies. The Manipulated Living and Dead both have weak recollections of the tangent universe, this is why Jim Cunningham burns his kiddie porn stash and kills himself and why at the end Gretchen and Donnie's mom have that weird waving moment. This is one of my favorite movies ever so sorry if I went a little overboard.",

He tried to yell cut but another explosion over shadowed his voice and they kept rolling. Someone said leaving the blood made it feel even more real and they stuck with it. Or something like that. It's one of my all-time favorite movies! EDIT: Found the clip from the article! \u201cI think we had 14 days to shoot the whole set piece, except by day 12, we hadn\u2019t rolled cameras yet,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n recalls. On the afternoon of the 13th day, they were finally ready to film. But around the 90-second mark, Cuar\u00f3n yelled \u201cCut\u201d because, as he puts it, the take \u201cwas just wrong.\u201d The reset took five hours, meaning they lost the daylight and had to go home. The morning of the final day dawned, and they gave it another stab. The cameras rolled, the scene commenced \u2014 then camera operator George Richmond tripped and the camera fell. Five hours of reset later, Cuar\u00f3n had only one chance left. Action. Owen ran, Richmond followed, and astoundingly, all was going smoothly. They got to a hollowed-out bus filled with people, through which Theo is supposed to scamper. Suddenly, one of the squibs misfired and, horror of horrors, a squirt of fake blood landed on the lens. Cuar\u00f3n, watching on a monitor, felt his world collapse. \u201cI yell, \u2018Cut!\u2019\u2009\u201d he says, recounting the moment like a ghost story. \u201cBut an explosion happens at the same time, so nobody hears me.\u201d The camera kept rolling, and Cuar\u00f3n realized he had no choice but to let it play through, even though he was sure the shot was ruined and had no idea how he would proceed. \u201cWhen we said, \u2018Cut,\u2019 Chivo starts dancing like crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, it didn\u2019t work! There\u2019s blood!\u2019 And Chivo turns to me and says, \u2018You stupid! That was a miracle!\u2019\u2009\u201d Chivo was right. One of the film\u2019s enduring strengths is how it uses hyper-minute details to lull you into accepting the plausibility of this dire reality: bus advertisements that hawk trendy clothes for dogs (kids may be gone, but capitalism isn\u2019t, so wouldn\u2019t the Gap push you to dress your pets?); Theo casually asking Julian if her parents were \u201cin New York when it happened\u201d and never explaining what terrifying event \u201cit\u201d might have been; or the elderly, white, German refugee using her native tongue to indignantly weep about being herded alongside Schwarzen. The blood-squib shot encapsulates this aesthetic, and has since become famous \u2014 an eerie moment that, once seen, can\u2019t be shaken, even ten years later. This dystopia doesn\u2019t feel like a metaphor or a cautionary tale; it feels like a revelation of deeper truth. As one of Children of Men\u2019s biggest fans, Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, put it in a documentary featurette that accompanied the DVD release, \u201cA good portrait is more you than you are, yourself, and I think this is what the film does with our reality \u2026 It simply makes reality more what it already is.\u201d",

This continued for hundreds of years when finally Gandhi finally took steps to abolish untouchability. Today, traces of casteism are still found in India but it has more or less vanished from developed areas of the nation.

The indigenous Ainu and people of Korean descent are often included in the *buraku* group. They had to live in special quarters, there were severe restrictions on what jobs they could hold, what resources they could use, and so on. Don't even get me started on marriages. While the *buraku* are not still officially discriminated against, it's easy to tell if your family was part of the *buraku*. There is still alot of prejudice against descendants of *burak* people, to the point where the Japanese refuse to let their daughters marry men of *buraku* descent, or refuse them certain work.",

My cast is Ramgharian (I don't believe in the caste system, but that is my caste anyway) which is basically a carpenter, or a small business owner. Growing up in a Sikh family, I pretty much regard myself as an atheist but of course my family wouldn't really approve of that. Back to the caste bias though; if I were to marry someone outside my caste my family wouldn't stop me, but they would question it and try to get me to marry a Ramgharian sikh girl, same goes if the person wasn't Indian. However as far I'm concerned pretty much all first generation immigrants don't really give a fuck about the caste system, we just joke about it. My dad wasn't born in the UK but he grew up here since he was 4 and back then in the 70s/80s it was more or less just stick with any of the (South) Asians or get beat up by the white guys. Back then it actually mad. It essentially just the white people provoking race wars between the Whites, Asians and Blacks, everyone was fighting everyone. Because of this it didn't really matter what caste you were, you had to stick with each other unless you wanted to get beaten or shanked. My mum who did grow up in India did experience the traces of casteism there. Never really asked her too much about it but I don't imagine it was too bad.",

And also I think you are only exposed to only a specific group of Chinese people, I can tell you some are definitely more accepting and respectful than others. I live in an area right now where there are a lot of Chinese people, some are exactly like you described, but guess what some other Chinese folks ABSOLUTELY HATE them too.. Why? Because it will make people like you make assumptions that Chinese people are like that. Chinese people are problematic with some of their viewpoints on things, and yes that needs to be changed. But they are getting better, especially at this age and time, people are stepping out of that zone and becoming more accepting. You also have to take on the fact that China itself isn't a very multicultural (it is multicultural as in it has many different ethnic groups.

The basis of whichever side of the issue is left or right, of course, depends on the current state of things, but it's important to remember not to use the extremes of each end of the spectrum (I mean, it's not even a spectrum now, but still) to define someone's true political stance.

[Further insight]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_whiteness_in_the_United_States) >The process of officially being defined as white by law often came about in court disputes over pursuit of citizenship. The Naturalization Act of 1790 offered naturalization only to \"any alien, being a free white person\". In at least 52 cases, people denied the status of white by immigration officials sued in court for status as white people. By 1923, courts had vindicated a \"common-knowledge\" standard, concluding that \"scientific evidence\" was incoherent. Your statement is based on not knowing what you're talking about.

                    "body": "Well, you asked! The *burakumin* have long been discriminated against. Their options in choosing a school, a workplace, a partner, were very limited. Since the *buraku*, along with everyone else, were registered in official records with names and occupations (which were often passed on to the children), they were easily traceable. You could just go to the registration office and look up the family. Since they were considered lower class citizens, marrying them, while not expressly forbidden, was considered a social taboo, which held true until way into the 1980s. It was not uncommon for the families of the couple to look into their family history or even hire someone to find out if they were *burakumin*. Since discrimination against *buraku* families has been made illegal, discimination soon found other forms. Engagements could not be broken off because you found out you were *buraku*, so people found a way around it, instead opting for seemingly non-discrimnatory reasons like \"the fortuneteller said it was bad luck\" - seriously, I'm not kidding here. The family put a lot of pressure on the couple: What if others found out you're married to a *burakumin*? Do you want to see your grandmother die of shame? What about your children, don't you want them to succeed in life? Think about your sister - how will she ever find a husband if people know that she has someone like that in her family? If the relationship isn't broken up, the engagement not dissolved, it's not unheard of even now for the couple to be disowned. A 2007 case study found that even in 2001, a third of all intermarriage couples had faced discrimination of that sort. Since family and your family's lineage still play a major role in Japan (even with ever-decreasing birth rates and population!), the social pressure can't be underestimated. To end on a happy note: Although the discrimination against marriage between *burakumin* and non-*buraku* has been steady for the past twenty years (and in some regions even increased), the overall number of intermarriages has increased. That means while the stigma is still there, the younger generation doesn't seem to be discouraged as easily anymore. Yay progress!",

Jews often wear specific articles of clothing or wear certain hairstyles for religious or cultural reasons that make them distinguishable. Many Jews also have specific accents due to living in ethnic enclaves. There's common last names that people are aware of. Additionally, Jewish people are very genetically homogenous due to religious rules around marriage which means they have pretty distinguishable features in many cases. Ashkenazi Jews might be white, due to intermarriage with Slavs and Germans over the centuries, but they often don't look like English or German people. That's less true as time goes on, but it's definitely the case now. Sephardic Jews and Mizrahi Jews are definitely not white, they're olive skinned or darker in most cases and are usually mistaken for Arabs if they don't wear identifiably Jewish garb. Jews experience violent hate crimes on a regular basis and have for centuries. They're not oppressed institutionally in metropolitan areas like most people of color, for being Jewish, but it's pretty comparable to the modern Chinese situation. Way worse violence in the past but still a lot of racism now despite some economic success. Roma, Slavs, Italians, Irish etc on the other hand blend in because our culture doesn't look for what makes them different anymore. Also, Poles are Slavs. ",

I live in the United States, though I can tell you from dealing with my immigrant relatives that it does go both ways. The Korean side of my family (mom's side) doesn't care as much, but there are several relatives on my Japanese side (dad's side) who stopped speaking to my parents for 10+ years. My grandma comes from a very, very, proud family and my dad's the eldest son, so that didn't go over too well. A few still aren't speaking to my parents (and me by extension). I'm not a psychologist by any means, but based on what I've observed of my mother I think she's coped with that by committing herself wholeheartedly to Japanese culture. You could technically call her a weeaboo. She believes Japanese aesthetics are superior (even to Korean culture), she sometimes peppers her speech with random Japanese words, she's obsessively studied Japanese culture (hence the burakumin) and she sometimes tells strangers that she's Japanese. There's a difference in motivation, though. My mom's not doing this just because she watched some random anime and thought it was cool. I suspect she's trying to protect me and my brother from discrimination, in her own way. She never taught either of us to speak Korean. She never went out of her way to teach us about Korean culture like she did with Japanese culture. I kind of feel like that side is lost to me nowadays. I never really grew up with it, so I don't understand it the way a Korean 'should'. The whole thing sometimes bleeds into other random events. My dad is a doctor and he told me he once had a Korean patient who was somewhat nervous around him. That went away when my dad mentioned that he was married to a Korean. Yeah, I don't know. I guess that's my long-ass way of saying that it's complicated. ",

That's Tina Watson. A few minutes before this photo, her husband turned off her air supply and held her underwater until she drowned. He then went up to the surface and told the other divers she was \"in trouble\", and you can see someone else swimming to try and save her. EDIT: He did serve 12 months in prison in Australia for Manslaughter, as a plea bargain (Neither he nor the court knew if he was going down for murder). When he returned home to Alabama, the US courts tried to get him on the grounds that he'd planned the murder there, but he got off due to lack of evidence. Australian authorities refused to help with the American trial, as they'd broken an extradition clause not to push for the death penalty. Edit 2: changed some info people have corrected me on. Also, the manslaughter charge managed to stick because despite apparently being a trained rescue diver, he made no evident effort to save her, or share his own functioning tank. Also one witness says he saw Gabe Watson \"engaged in a bearhug with his flailing wife\"",

Basically, the two half spheres would be adjusted around the core and the core activity would be measured. The risk was that if the spheres were allowed to close, the core would instantaneously form a critical mass. To keep them from closing, he pried the top core up with a screw driver. Unfortunately the screw driver slipped, a critical mass formed, and (near) instantly gave him a lethal dose of radiation. He shielded the other people in the room and was the only fatality. ",

Errol Morris' documentary [*Vernon, Florida*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083281/) Errol Morris is a great documentary maker that can really capture people well. This documentary is a look at a small rural town in Florida. The film doesn't really have a narrative. It's just made up of interviews with some of the colorful and quirky characters in their rather mundane small town. You can get a good feel for it from [the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2adr2XgQJKQ) And just based on that, it's a really neat documentary to watch. It's not the best documentary you'll ever see, but it's quaint, touching, often funny. But the thing is: that's not the documentary Errol Morris set out to make. In fact, the original name of the documentary was *Nub City*. You see, the city of Vernon, at the time, had the highest rate of limb amputation in America per capita. People missing fingers, hands, feet, etc. The messed up bit is that they were doing it to themselves, on purpose, in order to collect on insurance money. While filming the documentary, Errol Morris started receiving death threats from the residents who were scared he was going to expose their secret. Errol took the threats seriously enough that he re-edited the whole film so it never mentions anything about the amputations. So now it's just a nice documentary, about some colorful and quirky characters in their rather mundane small town. ",

As time went on John started to act stranger than normal (He was already very odd). He started to think his friend Schultz was spying on him. He believed that Schultz was hiding in his walls spying and plotting to kill him. It seems to me like John was a paranoid schizophrenic. Eventually John snapped. He drove up to Schultz's home and shot him in front of his family. Schultz died moments later. [Here's the account](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_du_Pont).

He also didn't burn down churches \"just because\", he burned them down because they were built over sacred Pagan worship ground by the Christians and he wanted to rid Judeo-Christian influence from Scandinavia, as the Christians took over and tried to erase the original religion and culture. I don't support Varg, but there's a lot more to this than you're making it sound like. He also has a fairly interesting youtube channel that is updated regularly: https://www.youtube.com/user/ThuleanPerspective Edit: That's also just a picture of Varg. I assumed you posted the one where he smiles at the camera after being sentenced for the church burnings, but the one you posted doesn't have anything special behind it.

When Columbine was going through the clean up and remodeling after April 20th all the current Columbine Students started going to school at Chatfield due to Columbine being unable to have classes. What I'm getting at is once they merged most considered the two public schools pretty much the same community. So to answer your question, no most parents allowed there kids to attend Columbine after 4-20 because at that point Chatfield (the only other public school) was just as likely to have the same thing happen to them as Columbine. Since 1998 I've heard that there's been another public school open in the area. Hope that answered your question. ",

The tour guide got everyone to stand in the middle of the room and he turned off the lights, then he used a light to create a flash. Afterwards, we all looked behind us and our shadows were temporarily on the wall. He explained that it had something to do with the radiation (At least that's what I remember, I was fairly young at the time.). It was very interesting.

The Unionist community is feeling increasingly isolated and under threat as the increasing Nationalist electorate start voting. Westminster's latest budget to NI continues to reduce (in real terms) meaning the government have less money to handle an already breaking public sector. There is no great driver for improving cross-community relations either, which results in serious rioting every summer. The Irish and British governments are also negating on their responsibilities to hold murderers to account for their actions, and there are campaigns to provide effective amnesty to members of the British Army who committed murder, which only serves to undermine the legal system and derail the ongoing peace process.

Thompson OTOH was apparently very scheming and manipulative, and able to put on this surface charm and friendliness. There are stories about how he charmed/manipulated his way into staying up later than the other kids, watching cricket and drinking tea with the warden and guards of the prison(!). Thompson apparently never showed any remorse for his actions, but did like discussing the Bulger case in an 'academic' way. The authorities seemed to see Venables as a waste-of-space loser who'd probably be coming right back, so they had no issue with releasing him when he turned 18.

It will cost our economy close to half a Billion pounds. People were pissed and because our government is built on power sharing (the two different communities must work together) this divided them.

It's like White Trash central, a one stop shop for all of your Floridian white trash needs. It's just miles upon miles of seedy strip clubs, places to buy tourist junk, and overbuilt hotels that hide the Gulf. It's hot and dirty and full of drunks. So, so gross. I can't understand for the life of me why anyone would willingly pay money to \"vacation\" there. Some of the most beautiful beaches in Florida are just up the road from there too. I stayed a few days in Rosemary Beach and was amazed at how lovely it was. It was almost Outer Banks-like, which is crazy for Florida, with walk over dunes and everything, except the sand was softer and whiter and the water was prettier.",

In the 90s the boardwalk used to be more alive and family friendly. The pavilion was the birthplace of the \"shag\" and you couldn't miss out on the carnival atmosphere. Since then however, the pavilion is gone (partially relocated to one of the four outdoor malls) but is still family friendly before dark. It's more of a bar scene late at night with immature people riding the strip looking for attention. I would say that's the worst part if you're looking for something to complain about. There are still plenty of attractions (Ripley's, Wax Museum, Wonderworks, water parks) and more miniature golf courses than you can count. And tons of great places to eat (Hard Rock Cafe, Wahlburgers, Duplin Winery, tons of seafood buffets, but I highly recommend Mr. Fish- fresh locally caught seafood). The beach does get pretty crowded in the summer during the day on Ocean Blvd (where most hotels are). If you are going for a secluded beach type vacation then you will be disappointed. The \"Waves\" stores you are talking about are obvious tourist shops with misleading sales. Stay away unless you want an I &lt;3 Myrtle Beach shirt. Overall, it's a nice vacation spot if you like the tourist vibe, as there is plenty to do, and are ok with crowds. I wouldn't consider Myrtle Beach trashy just because you like a more reserved vacation, but I can't speak for the tourists. ",

You can eat in the cafe with the big windows and feel like you're in \"North by Northwest\". You should even have time (we did) to drive over to Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which is amazing as well.

It also has a lovely atmosphere. Exploring the park, trying all the weird foods, trying to figure out who the hell Duffy is and why he's everywhere - it's all part of a wonderful experience. Tokyo DisneySea was one of my favorite days in my entire trip to Japan, and we've been here since January. Go on a weekday for slightly smaller crowds, and do get fast passes ASAP.

As for Austin, much younger crowd with the University near. A lot more traffic, a lot less space, and far faster paced. More things to do and more hipster type vibe here, which gives the city its uniqueness. Bigger night life attraction with 6th street here too. Cost of living is higher here, but often people are okay with that to be able to trade off all that Austin has to offer. ",

Each part of the city has its own flavor and everyone is honestly pretty friendly. It's Tex-Mex through and through, and I can't imagine living anywhere else to be honest. San Antonio is the quieter of the two cities. If you want a hip, trendy city Austin is your thing. But if you want to snuggle into a niche, I'd say San Antonio is an amazing place.

We went walking around Clifton Hill and found most of the shops, fun houses, wax museums and arcades to be empty. It was creepy, because the entrances were all unlocked, the music was playing, the lights and robotic features were all working, but nobody was around to work the desks. Two of my friends did a complete tour through one of the museums without ever paying at the desk or even seeing an employee. *It took forever to find a place for dinner (most were closed or grossly overpriced) and when we did, it had no other customers. The waiter seemed a little too thrilled to see us, and wanted to sit down at the same booth to talk while we ate. He literally said that \"Nobody ever comes here.\" *After sunset, we wanted to go to the local casino. Even though we could clearly see the building, we had no idea how to actually get to it. Every pathway seemed blocked off by a high wall, gate, or other impassable barrier. We tried approaching from all sorts of directions and still couldn't get to the entrance. We ended up climbing up a very steep wooded hillside in the middle of the night to find our way in. *Passed through some empty underground tunnel at around 2 AM, where a random Russian woman stood all alone in the freezing cold, urging us to buy some plastic flowers for our \"sweethearts.\" *Stayed at a deserted hotel, woke up in the morning and found that a monstrous snowstorm had hit in the span of one or two hours. It took forever to free our car from the snow and get back to the states without incident. ",

                    "body": "You are right. I have worked at the US state park on and off for a while now so I could probably go into detail about this. Niagara Falls State Park is the first state park in the country, but was founded a few years after the first couple of National Parks were founded. Basically, the deal with Niagara Falls is that back during the 1800's, most of the land around the Falls and gorge were privately owned. Both sides were heavily developed and the Niagara River was mostly used for generating power for the factories. Tourism wasn't a really big thing. People who would travel to Niagara Falls would get disappointed when they couldn't really see or get close to the Falls. A private land owner literally erected as wall that blocked off view where the current state parks are. Around this same time, new lands out west like Yosemite and Yellowstone were being \"discovered\". Images popularized by paintings and recently invented photographs started spreading around the US. People on the East Coast didn't want to see the same thing happen to Yosemite as what happened with Niagara Falls (developing cities around it and using the site for it's natural resources). So the first federal protections were given to them and they were signed into law as National Parks (the National Parks Service wouldn't come till the early 20th century). At the time, the Adirondack Park in New York had become the standard for nature conservation and recreation/tourism.It's the biggest sect of protected land in the lower 48 (over 6 million acres) and is bigger than Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Everglades and Smokey Mountain Parks combined. The Adirondack Park was used as the conservation example for how the new National Parks should be administered, it's land management and tourism efforts were used as a sort of blue print for how the earliest National Parks were ran and how future ones would be operated. So why not make Niagara Falls a National Park? When this was all happening, it was creating a lot of problems and confusion with New York's land management. The Adirondack Park was the premier outdoor destination at the time and was just as famous as Niagara Falls, Yosemite or anyplace else. The problem with the Adirondacks though is that it's protection is straight up written into New York's constitution. It is meant to be left forever wild and with very low density natural resource use. Because of this, New York didn't want to give up it's control/protection of it's land to the Federal government so it had to create a work around. Niagara Falls was too late to be written into New York's constitution like the Adirondacks , but they didn't want to give it up to the Federal government. So instead they created the concept of a State Park and it's been that way ever since (since the 1880's). Doing this also helped get around a lot of issues that came up with sharing the river/gorge with Canada and allowed for a lot of treaties/pacts with New York and Ontario's governments. The three waterfalls do have federal protection on both sides though now, they are all national monuments in both the US and Canada. The US side is also now a National Heritage Area and Congress has passed legislation exploring the possibility of a unified national park being ran in conjunction with NY state agencies.",
