He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.\" ",

Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion. In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. In Too Deep is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like In the Air Tonight and Against All Odds. Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is Sussudio, a great, great song, a personal favorite.",

He had such a knowledge of alternative facts that he could even keep the more qualified candidates he was running against... from winning. The Alt-Right is a pathway to many abilities, some considered to be undemocratic. He became so powerful that the only thing he was afraid of was having a small inauguration crowd, which eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught Steve Bannon everything he knew, then Steve Bannon took over the government in his sleep. It's ironic; he could save others from fake news, but not himself. Sad!",

It crept through the stairway; it crept through the hall - It crept through the bedroom, and stopped at the wall! 'I'm waiting,' a whisper emerged from within - 'It's time to delight in a night full of sin! The children are sleeping; the husband's away - I'm willing and wanton and wanting to play! 'The love of another is precious to find - But better's the lusts of an *other* in kind! Excite me, delight me, and better I'll be - Fulfil me and fill me, instil me with glee!' And so, with a tickle, a whimper, a sigh - The crack of a whip and a moan and a cry - She treasured the pleasure, and saw it was true. A Who likes to do who a Who likes to do.",

He sprang to his feet from off of his back, His feet hit the floor with a tremendous \"WHACK!\" He bent over Tina, he bent her did Ted, He bent Tina over the side of the bed. Tina did scream with joy and delight, As bed Ted bamswaggled her flumpus all night, They diddled and fiddled and bliddled in bed, They diddled and fiddled did Tina and Ted. And then with a gush and a glorious moan, Ted in the bed reached orgasm alone, \"I thought you'd hold out!\" moaned Tina so sadly, \"I tried but I couldn't, try not to feel badly!\" Tina reached in the nightstand which sat by the bed, The bed she sat in with now unconscious Ted, She pulled out a vibrator and flipped on its power, She gurgled and moaned for the next quarter hour, She gurgled and moaned, and she gurgled some more, Ted awoke with a start and said \"What's that thing for?\" She looked in his eyes and she said with a smile, \"Your dick did the trick, but just for a while.\" Edit: popped my gold cherry! thank you kind stranger!

Sometimes a hair gets caught back there, I nearly choke, she's unaware, these hairy holes may end me yet, but I can't stop, I've got her wet. Now that she's wet I get my schlong, it's thick and throbbing, a mile long. I aim it tried, I aim it true, I slide it in and yell Yahoo! I'm going in, I'm going out, I'm flailing wildly all about. I'm getting close, I feel the twinge, when suddenly something makes me cringe. It started small but now it burns, I sparked a fire with all these churns.

Our tale now begins In a small town of Schmire This lovely young couple Was so full of fire. . He was a switch All through and through A penchant for whips- We'll call him Sir Blue. . She's not a mistress Or a brat like you'd think Just a sweet baby girl- We'll call her Lil Pink. . They'd dated so long And lived in the scene Lil Pink; always nice Sir Blue; nicely mean . Every munch, every meet They'd try to attend Though she liked to sneak out before they would end. . As time would pass their interest would slow When Sir blue had to work Lil Pink wouldn't go. . One morning she grabbed him With a sense of frustration \"I need time with you, Not just masturbation!!\" . He lowered his head Yes, he knew it was true. Sir Blue wasn't \"sir\", He was just simply Blue. . Later that day He hatched a plan Collected his things Like a horny young man . He gathered his toys His crops, ropes, and whips Some tiny clamps That went on Pink's nips. . He carefully arranged them from big to small Huge dildos and vibrators. I can't list them all! . Grabbing his bag Not a thing would be missed. He jammed in the toys. Even the big rubber fist. . While she was at work, She looked at her phone \"When you get home, I will make you moan\" . She sent back a wink Awaiting the surprise And sneakily she snuck The phone in her thighs. . All day he would text her Every act; every grunt. Her phone would vibrate Against her dripping cunt. . Lil Pink nearly came Before work was out Luckily she didn't, She was known to shout . When she got home he was waiting He made Dinner and a drink. She wanted him now But he gave her a wink . They ate and they drank, Then he gave her a box: A brand new blindfold And a small cute stuffed fox! . Sir Blue kissed her neck Not snagging her hairs. He blindfolded lil Pink And took her up stairs. . She was eager for him Not knowing his plot: Face down on his bed With a growing wet spot. . He ripped off her shirt. He tore off her skirt Sir Blue was so hard That it actually hurt. . He fucked her right there For hours, then days. He fucked her in all The kinktastic ways. . He spanked her until she was red black and blue. Her ass was every Lovely and painful hue. . And that's how they died, Those poor kinky souls: Starved each other to death While stuffing those holes. . When they arrived in hell They were surrounded with screams, Pitchforks, and torture- A land of their dreams.",

This was April 1976, in Cambridge, U.K. I was a bit early for the train. I\u2019d gotten the time of the train wrong. I went to get myself a newspaper to do the crossword, and a cup of coffee and a packet of cookies. I went and sat at a table. I want you to picture the scene. It\u2019s very important that you get this very clear in your mind. Here\u2019s the table, newspaper, cup of coffee, packet of cookies. There\u2019s a guy sitting opposite me, perfectly ordinary-looking guy wearing a business suit, carrying a briefcase. It didn\u2019t look like he was going to do anything weird. What he did was this: he suddenly leaned across, picked up the packet of cookies, tore it open, took one out, and ate it. >Now this, I have to say, is the sort of thing the British are very bad at dealing with. There\u2019s nothing in our background, upbringing, or education that teaches you how to deal with someone who in broad daylight has just stolen your cookies. You know what would happen if this had been South Central Los Angeles. There would have very quickly been gunfire, helicopters coming in, CNN, you know\u2026 But in the end, I did what any red-blooded Englishman would do: I ignored it. And I stared at the newspaper, took a sip of coffee, tried to do aclue in the newspaper, couldn\u2019t do anything, and thought, What am I going to do? >In the end I thought Nothing for it, I\u2019ll just have to go for it, and I tried very hard not to notice the fact that the packet was already mysteriously opened. I took out a cookie for myself. I thought, That settled him. But it hadn\u2019t because a moment or two later he did it again. He took another cookie. Having not mentioned it the first time, it was somehow even harder to raise the subject the second time around. \u201cExcuse me, I couldn\u2019t help but notice\u2026\u201d I mean, it doesn\u2019t really work. >We went through the whole packet like this. When I say the whole packet, I mean there were only about eight cookies, but it felt like a lifetime. He took one, I took one, he took one, I took one. Finally, when we got to the end, he stood up and walked away. Well, we exchanged meaningful looks, then he walked away, and I breathed a sigh of relief and st back. >A moment or two later the train was coming in, so I tossed back the rest of my coffee, stood up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper were my cookies. The thing I like particularly about this story is the sensation that somewhere in England there has been wandering around for the last quarter-century a perfectly ordinary guy who\u2019s had the same exact story, only he doesn\u2019t have the punch line. >-Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt",

She grew up in poverty and moving to teach in an impoverished area? She knew how it went. I still get teary eyed thinking of how she paid for me and my friend to eat because she saw us take a half-eaten bag of chips out of the trash to eat it. Some little asshole was taunting us with the fact he could afford it and we couldn't, then threw it away in front of us. So, whenever she could, she bought us lunch. I loved that woman.

Still stands out to me because it was comical and made me realize that even though she was a teacher, she was kind of a dork too. I think even at that age there was a tendency to think of teachers as being stodgy adults who just give lectures and assign tests.

Revered by the students for his eccentricity, his loud voice, and his willingness to go to bat for hia students if they were in trouble. I was one of the \"four year wonders,\" that is someone who joined the drama department at the beginning of freshman year and stayed until graduation. I took every class offered, from acting to directing to tech theater (which is part of yhe reason why I'm now a professional stage hand and have been for the last 10 years). But the lesson in question came from the acting class. Quinn was himself a previous student of Uta Hagen, someone those of you with acting backgrounds will immediately recognize. Quinn taught us Method Acting in the Meisner style. Acting is doing. Become the character. We went through endless Meisner exercises: repetition, the door, the broom, etc. For many students it was just a little too heady to understand. It wasn't until later in life that I realized how important that lesson on \"become the character\" was. Becoming the character of \"the employee\" or \"the boyfriend\" or \"the brother\" made me better in those roles. I was a better employee, a better boyfriend, a better brother. It helped me become more successful and a better person. Sadly, Mr Quinn is no longer with us. Colon cancer had to have it's say. He was diagnosed when I was a senior, and when he had his surgeries there quite literally wasn't a moment when one of his students wasn't at his bedside. Even at 2am on a school day, one of us was there. He initially fought it off, and was around long enough for me to delightedly tell him about my new career in professional theater, and regale him with backstage tales from major Broadway tours. But then the cancer came back, harder and more agressive. He quickly wasted away. I visited him at his home about a month before he passed, because I wanted to tell him about running a production of Die Fledermaus, one of his favorite operettas. Despite his pain, despite his exhaustion, he perked right up to hear what I had to say, and was even able to quietly laugh at some of the foibles the show gave us. When he passed, the school held an enormous memorial service. Over two thousand people attended, the vast majority being former students. We told stories, cried, hugged each other. My sister, another four year wonder, evem sang the old folk song \"The Mighty Quinn\" in his honor. I kinda veered off there from the original question, but I get kinda emotional and nostalgic when I remember those days. They were the overwhelmingly best part of my high school experience. Still miss you, you dumb, dirt-licking gourd-head.",

I've always found that *Wuthering Heights* hits that sweet spot of being both melodramatic and boring, but my teacher came up with the best solution: skits.

Featuring a student who had a passionate argument with himself, periodically swirling a cape around to indicate which character he was at any given time. 2. \"We Thought We Were Doing This on Friday: The Musical\" was a slightly-less-than-polished (they presented on Thursday) rendition of a scene in which a ghost is at the narrator's window. They set the scene, introduced the ghost, and then the narrator was trying to get rid of the ghost. \"Let me go, let me go\"/\"I will not let you go\" quickly turned into Bohemian Rhapsody. Most of the class joined in singing, and we went through the entire song together. There were enough people involved that I could even sing\u2014in public!\u2014knowing that my tone-deaf warbling would be covered up by other people's voices. That's probably the part of my teenage years that most resembles a cheesy movie, and I am OK with that.",

Since this is a kind of difficult part of *Wuthering Heights* to understand, I'll just be narrating. We'll start where we left off yesterday, everyone open your books to page 67\" It works. Every year. No one has questions. They kind of like question if this is really happening, and then get on board. A few pick up on it immediately, and have a goofy smile all of class. But for the half engages kid who now has an entire our to quietly wonder what the fuck is going on, they realize - almost always - that it's an example of double speak. At the end of class, he has a 5 minute PowerPoint on 1984. If questioned, he just says \"I'm reaching *1984*. I've always been teaching *1984*\", and moves on.

I thought okay cool no one did it this time great. Once my teacher walked in he walked directly to the board and rolled up the projector screen and saw a fuck you. He gasped and began to be furious. He eventually calmed down to explain he was the one writing the fuck yous because he wanted to teach the part of the book where Dunstan tries to erase them in NY so his sister keeps her innocence.

To demonstrate how feudalism worked the teacher gave everyone a cup of, if I remember correctly, 15 M&Ms and a rank. There were Peasants, Knights, Nobles and the King. The Peasants were the most numerous group and there was only one King. Then, everyone had to pay taxes. The Peasants had to give some of their M&Ms to a Knight, the knights would have to give some of their M&Ms to a Noble and the Noble would have to give some M&Ms to the King. I was personally one of the Nobles and the look on the lower ranks faces as they saw their cups drain was priceless. The whole process start to finish certainly did a good job of getting the general idea of feudalistic governing into our heads.",

I was fortunate enough to attend the \"better education\" system in my city, and most of the teachers there genuinely cared about their students and were doing their job because they loved it and not because they had no other option. A lot of my memories come from 10th grade. I had an AP Language teacher that was always enthusiastic with her kids and excited to be there, and even though it was one of the toughest classes since she gave very few people As, I looked forward to it almost every day since she just had this charm that made us interested in the material. The other AP Language teacher wrote personalized motivational notes for every single student he had, and gave them to his students the day before the AP exam. I have a few more favorites. My IB Chem teacher in 11th grade has a Ph.D like most of the AP science teachers at my school. Most of them could've done something better but instead they chose to teach (Or maybe this was the only job they could get, but at least they showed enthusiasm when teaching). Anyways, he was basically Mr.Rogers to us. First day of school, he spoke in this soothing soft voice and said something like this \"Don't be afraid to ask us, we're just like you, we're not going to judge you, I understand what you're going through. Come by any time and I'll work things out with you. If you're having problems, I'll sit by you and work them out with you. Don't think of us as robots that spawn in the classroom everyday, remember that we're humans that care about you.\" Once a week, he'd give us life lessons and give us a piece of motivational advice or perhaps some information on how to pay bills or how to fix a car, etc. During school events, he'd always dress up, and wore silly costumes during Halloween and before Christmas break to make his kids laugh, and even built a Christmas tree made out of lab materials with us. He actually gave us personalized gift bags with candy and other goodies for Christmas, and made the class very enjoyable by showing that he actually cared about his students. He actually invited us to his band concert events, and I went to them with a few friends and had some outside interaction with him which was nice since I got to see another side of him. I have so many more examples, but it would take me hours to write. Thank you to all dedicated teachers who chose to be one in order to make a difference. Everyone emphasizes doctors, engineers, and scientists, but it's people like you who create them and start the change :) EDIT: Why is this getting downvoted? ",

I had her as a freshman for algebra and I was a little SHIT (like 99.99999% of high school freshman are) and she NEVER gave up on me or anyone in that class. She wanted to see you graduate and go on to college or trade school or whatever, no matter how shitty your home life was. She listened to your problems and got resources for kids whose families could not afford things like eyeglasses or insurance and helped kids who needed it get on free or reduced lunch (I went to a high school where there were fairly rich well off families and others somewhat on the opposite side of things). She was not afraid to yell at you and call your mom/dad, but she always said she loved you and cared. If you needed food or supplies, she would either give it to you or sell it to you for like 50 cents or $1, which was over 1/2 the price of the school food. She treated her peer tutors like family. I peer tutored and one day she gave all the peer tutors fresh loaves of bread to take home to their families and always offered us fresh bagels or other things to take home. She always asked how my mom was and remembered I had a brother and when I mentioned his name always referred to him by name after that (which one teacher who I had for 4 years didn't even know I had one or his name until I was a sophomore and didn't remember his name until I was a junior) even though he didn't come to my school and wouldn't. Even if you didn't have her and you came in to her room, there was always the offer of food and support. She probably singlehandedly was the reason a few kids graduated and walked across that stage. She took the time to explain not only math, but if something was going on in the world, she made sure you knew that things were going on outside of our town. She honored the arts and those who did them in a school where sports were king. She was the first and only of the teachers to call when a classmates father passed away to check to see what she could do for the family and how they were doing, who had come from another country some years prior and didnt have much, if at all, in country family. It wasn't just that she was a great teacher, but all the extra she did on top of it. Ms H at CHS, thank you. There was also the math teacher who would throw an event for all the drama kids after the plays and made sure that they knew how much they were recognized in the school. And the wonderful science department, full of former researchers who worked at UCs and in labs, who practically let me live in the building for my first 2.5 years of high school while my parents worked a lot and were who I would call my second through seventh moms.",

He would have 1-2 classes a week where we just strictly took notes, but the other 3-4 he would do these skits where we got to perform out things from history that we learned from those notes. He was energetic as about a 60 year old man could be. He let us do a project based on Roman history and we loved his class so much we did a ton of research to make the best video possible. We spent a full week acting, editing, and doing this crazy stuff because we loved what we learned so much. We ended up getting like 145 points with extra credit, the highest grade he's given out still I believe. His usage of gumby was always odd to us because while we thought it was funny usually, it didn't make any sense that he had this obsession with a random character. But on the last day of class he told us why he loved Gumby. Gumby was a piece of dough that could turn himself into anything that he needed to to complete a task. He told us how any of us could mold ourselves for what lied ahead, and to adapt to the challenges facing us. Gumby was the hero he could be and we all could become the hero we could be, and we shouldn't let a boxes in school, society, or life ever hold us back. I still always remember that and it's helped me today think of new ways to approach problems and do everything I can, and adapt. I've looked him up and I guess he's retired now but I hoe he remembers the effect he's had on students. ",

She always encouraged us to try out things, she expected us to do our best, but never forced us, because she honestly wanted us to enjoy excercise and she helped us discover the things we liked. She had very nice rules. If you didn't want to participate in a certain team sport, after practicing a bit you were allowed to run around the track and do excercises individually. If you were too afraid to do certain things like a handstand, she offered assistance but you were allowed to stick to easier things. You had 2 \"free passes\" in each semester which meant that if you notified her before, you wouldn't be listed absent, without any questions asked, and you could do this 2 times. We didn't abuse this, it was just very reassuring that this opportunity existed, in case of a period accident for example. Of course she praised those who performed very well, but at the same time she never humiliated the rest of us. She was so kind. I'm still grateful for her.",

One day, the wife is shopping for dinner when she notices a new brand of ham on display. She asks the kid behind the counter what ham it is. \"Oh, that's Dam Ham.\" The wife replies \"You know, young man, you really shouldn't be using foul language in front of the preacher's wife\"! The employee explains \"Oh, no! That's the name of the brand: Dam Ham, with just the m.\" \"Oh, OK. I think I'll have some of this Dam Ham\"! So she goes home and starts making dinner. A few hours later, the preacher returns home. \"Hey honey, what's cooking\"? The wife tells him \"That's Dam Ham honey.\" Shocked, the preacher berates her \"Now we're a godly family, and you know if we start cussing inside the home it's only a matter of time before we start cussing in public.\" The wife explains \"Oh, no, I wasn't cussing! That's what the brand is called\"! The preacher says \"Well that's all right then. It's delicious too, I can't wait for supper.\" Finally, Junior gets home from school, so they gather around the table while the preacher leads them in prayer. After he finishes his famously long prayer, the preacher turns to his wife and says, \"Pass me some of that Dam Ham, honey.\" Junior is floored. Not once in his life has he ever heard his father say a bad word. After a long pause, Junior says \"That's the spirit, Dad! And while you're at it, pass me some of the fucking mashed potatoes\"!\" Needless to say, Mr. Rush became our favorite teacher after that.",

That's Marginal Utility, and that (pointing to the student) was not impressive. I put away more dounts in the morning then you ever have in your life. Welcome to the minor leagues.\" Dude is probably approaching 70 now and that was only 4 years ago. He was a very interesting person and probably the greatest teacher I ever had.",

He was trying to be a composer or something for Hollywood stuff, but when that didn't work out, our principal gave him his job as a teacher. He had a piano in his classroom to fiddle around with when things were quiet, or he'd play on it for someone's birthday. In addition to physics, he taught geometry, algebra, precalc, and chemistry (I only had him for geometry beforehand - it was a class easy enough to sleep through, and I decided to not change classes because it was easy and there was a really cute girl). He wrote us into the quizzes and exams to set up the problems, and was generally a very relaxed person. He had a sickle in his closet for some reason. One time, he printed spiders on everyone's quizzes. When it was dead silent, he hollered, \"WATCH OUT THERE'S A SPIDER\" and smacked the nearest student's paper. His jack-of-all-trades collection of interests helped me come to terms with how my own interests changed every year or so. Sadly, he retired some years ago - he had a partner, who had passed away, and couldn't handle that pain. Hopefully he's doing better now. ",

Teacher didn't say a word...walked over to one girl's desk and dumped some clear liquid (acetone, we found out) on the floor, turned and disappeared into the lab closet for a few moments. Still no words. He walks back out spinning an empty 5-gallon water jug like he was coating the inside with something. During that, he asks the girl \"is the floor dry?\" ... \"Yes\" ... and he goes into maybe a 20-second explanation of why the acetone evaporates so quickly. While still spinning the water jug. Finally he puts it on the lab bench, walks to the door, looks down the hallway both ways, closes the door, turns off the lights, lights a match and drops it into the jug... WHOOOOSH! Quick flame in the jug, so fast the jug was rocking back and forth on the table now. He walks over, puts the jug back in the closet, turns on the lights, opens the door just as the assistant principal walks by, smiles and waves, and continues on with class like nothing happened. Finally we had to ask him what that was all about, and he responded that he had the water jug from when he replaced it in the teacher's lounge, had a little bottle of gasoline (what he was coating the inside of the jug with) for another experiment he was doing with a different class, and basically did it just because he wanted to. He was hysterical and will always be one of my favorite teachers. \ud83d\ude02",

We would spend whole classes on one punctuation symbol and practice it until we knew it. And then spend a whole day on specific types of clauses. This continued on throthe whole year until we were all able to write coherent essays. He was fired that year for failing to follow the curriculum. But he taught me more than any other teacher has.

In the same lesson, we learned about survival skills. We went in the school yard and used magnifying glass to make fire. He was teaching us how to do it and explaining light, etc... When we smell fire and see smoke. Two class clowns decided to start without him and set our school yard on fire. I didn't personally see it, but I'm pretty sure they had a lighter to aid the process. (It was fall in Texas...dry, hot, and dead grass). It spread really fast. By this point, the whole class is trying to stomp at the fire. One kid runs in to grab a fire extinguisher. About that time, we hear the fire alarm go off, all the kids are filing out (this was before cell phones, so someone must have called 911 on the inside) and we then hear the fire trucks (right down the road from school). They get the fire put out, my teacher gets a slap on the wrist and all is well. We come back inside and he carries on about the lesson like we didn't almost catch the school on fire. Great teacher and I learned more about life from that guy than I did from any other teacher. TL; DR: Physics teacher gives lesson on light and kids light school yard on fire. ",

When it came time to present them, there was a very somber mood in the classroom (for obvious reasons), and the teacher played Taps in the background for music while each person went up and talked about the individual. After presenting, the teacher went and put a thumbtack in the map of the state that corresponded with the hometown of where that person was from. The note cards we used carrying that information was hung up on the cabinet and left up there for the rest of the year.

He also knew that even though I could study a bit, I wasn't able to stay caught up on the assignments, and was willing to determine my entire grade based on the final. That was pretty stressful at the time, but it was a much better option than having to do a semester's work of homework or retake the class. He said that the real importance of the class was for me to learn the material, not to do piles of work. Thanks to his flexibility, that was the only class I got credit for that semester. I was able to have him for two other years and he was a massive part of me being somewhat successful in high school despite the other issues. ",

Have you ever asked yourself why you choose to follow this one?\" That was normal 10th grade English and I ended up liking her class so much that I took the advanced placement English class in 11th grade just because she was the teacher for that class. In 11th grade she taught me that when it comes to learning new things, it's going to be uncomfortable and that means you're learning. She also taught me that a rough draft shouldn't just be edited to be a final draft- you should rewrite the essay without looking at your rough draft and just copying it. This keeps ideas more fluid and you'll have a better flow of ideas than your rough draft did. God I miss her lol. ",

My homework and classwork was always fine but when it came to tests, I always seemed to bomb. It was really discouraging because I knew the stuff, it just couldn't translate. One time I went for extra help, we went over the lesson from the previous class and he gave me a 'practice' worksheet. I finish it, bring it up and he looks over it. Then puts an 'A' at the top of the paper and smiles. It took me a moment but I then I realized he had gave me the test for the next class...I aced it, I was in shock. He said: \"You see? I knew you could do it, you're smart, you just have test anxiety and that's not uncommon\" He figured out that the only reason I was flunking tests was my nerves and lack of confidence, it had nothing to do with me not knowing the material. It was an epiphany for me and my confidence was boosted. He was the only teacher that had ever did that. He really went the extra mile to not only help me, but understand me. I left the extra help session with a weight off my shoulders and from then on (even though math still wasn't my strongest subject) I learned to not psyche myself out so much when it came to tests.

But this letter was nothing but praise for not just my work in his class but just me as a person. The amount of confidence that single letter instilled in me as a freshmen played a pretty big part of me pursuing math in college. The second memory is of one of our lessons on derivatives. We were studying Newton's law of cooling and after studying it in class and working through some problems, he had us all go to the coffee shop nearby. He then bought everyone a drink plus one that he placed in the middle of a table. We all then took measurements and used the law we just learned about to predict the temperature in 20 minutes.

The tube was like a foot long.](http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mGKiobFCYUPVp-eV_1VevDA.jpg) He would fill it up with water at the beginning of class and if he saw someone sleeping he'd pick it up from his desk and shoot the water across the classroom to hit him/her. Our class president was in my class and he slept a lot, so he got sprayed a lot, and decided to snitch to the principal so the teacher would have to stop. Principal came during class and asked him for the syringe. Teacher kindly sprayed the remaining contents into the sink and let the principal take it away. After the principal left the teacher opened a desk drawer and pulled out another syringe that was already filled with water. He would have these really random and spontaneous physics questions for us to do. He'd stand in the middle of the room and say, \"I'm 6'4\" and I'm dropping this 15 gram marker from that height. SOLVE.\" Then he'd drop the pen and go sit at his desk. But my ALL TIME FAVORITE. He always attempted to move things WITH HIS MIND. He had this telekinesis book on his desk that he would read when we were taking a test or doing a lab and he would occasionally put his book down, put his left index and middle finger on his temple, and then use his right index and middle fingers to try and nudge stuff around on his desk. Based on how much I know about him, I'm like 90% sure he would actually try telekinesis and it wasn't just a joke.",

Then, suddenly, she exploded in frustration at how long it was taking us, told each student to take a colour, pick a part of the drawing, and do it assembly-line style. The picture had two identical sides, so she said to just start over on the other side. She would literally yell at us when we took too long, and she didn't even give us enough time to stay inside the lines. We were intimidated and nervous, and all our pictures started to look awful. For the last third of class, she calmed down, told us it was all fake, and had us find the person who ended up with our original picture. The point, it turned out, was that the pictures we had been allowed to colour on our own looked so much better, and the conditions were nicer as well. It was a very creative way to teach us and not waste time on the day before break.",

This one class she has is absolute hell. They talk, sleep, interrupt her. (Sie in der Regel sehr unh\u00f6flich.) Well there was a stretch of time where the class was well behaved, and i figured id buy the class candy. When i came in, we all had a great time, ate candy and had a great class. Welp at the end of class, they had strung out trash and left the room a mess. Drinks spilled, paper, and all hell of mess. i was stressed out about multitudes of things, and i was going through a break up that was particularly horrific. I stayed after class to clean up (even though i had no ride home) after i cleaned up all of this, i burst into tears and couldnt move. I was absolutely crushed by their behaviour towards her and I after all we did for them that day. She came up next to me (this is an extremely tall german lady, built similar to Schwarzenegger) and just comforted me. It felt like a mixture of a tower of a person next to me. But i felt comforted. This was the first time since my dad left (when i was 7) that i felt appreaciated. She and i have been pretty close ever since. I go there during lunch, i go before classes and visit regularly. This woman is possibly the nicest person I've met in my entire life. I owe my love for the German language to her. Im planning on majoring in foreign language if i can. She's been tormented by a class of hooligans and she doesn't deserve it. So to sum it up, she keeps every single day a new experience as to not bore students, and In my opinion, She's absolutely the best teacher on the face of the planet. ",

I kept decent grades throughout the rest of the years and never did anything mischievous, and also built up good banter with all the teachers. So I felt a bit stabbed when I wasn't on the prefect list quite frankly. A friend of mine actually let my head-of-year know that I was a little frustrated at this (completely unbeknownst to me); and one day in December, Mr. R (we'll call him) called me as I entered the front doors of the school first thing in the morning. It took me by surprise, *was I in trouble? *did he find out that I set a bit of my book on fire with a Busen burner?* I [genuinely] thought to myself. \"*Hi /u/Adk96, please, have a seat.\" We got some small talk over and done with. Then, he reaches into the draws to the side of his desk while smirking \"we all know Christmas is the time for giving,\" and then he handed me a prefect tie and badge. \"and i would like to give this to you. You deserve it.\" I was astounded. I'd love to see the look on my face from his perspective. He had been my head-of-year for 5 years, and was definitely my favourite teacher ever.",

I was the class clown and I brought home good grades. Despite the fact I seem to be in good spirits she saw through my coping mechanism. This one particularly bad day ( I lost a friend to an apparent suicide) she saw me lose it. We were between classes and she saw me sneak out the door leading to the staff parking lot. This practice was one not unusual for a student trying to sneak a smoke break. I'm guessing she assumed I was trying to do just that. Instead, when she came out she found me sitting with my head in my hands absolutely losing it. She asked me if I needed to talk, and I just let it all out. my home life,my friend's death, everything. I think that's when the mother and her kicked in. She helped me to my feet and gave me the biggest hug ever. I just cried on her shoulder. And then she told me three words I really needed to hear at the time: \" you're worth something.\" I didn't have to say it, at that point I was contemplating suicide. Had she not been there that day, I more than likely would have gone through with it. I'm 35 now, and she is still a friend of mine on Facebook. She congratulated me on the birth of my son. And still listens when I need to talk to someone. Let it be known, sometimes Angels take the form of a teacher or somebody that is expected to lead a great example.

The very last week of 1st grade, I was out with the chicken pox (this was close to 20 years before the vaccine was a thing; chicken pox was a mandatory 5 days out of school). I was heart broken. I'd switched schools from K to 1st and had been scared because the only people I knew at my new school were my cousins, and the one in my grade wasn't in my class. But my teacher, who was in her last year of teaching, had welcomed and reassured my socially awkward 6 year old self, was interested in me, we just clicked very well. She had a huge stash of Barbies in her room and I always got to be the one to get them out during indoor recess. We all knew she was retiring and I was devastated that I wouldn't get to say good bye. So the last day of school my cousins are sent home with all my things, neatly packed by my teacher. At the bottom, there was a gift wrapped square. She'd bought me a Barbie figure skating book (it was the year Kristi Yamaguchi won the Winter Olympics, I was skating obsessed most of the year, as was most of the female population of my school). Inside the front cover was a beautiful letter about how much she'd miss me, how proud she was of me, how happy she'd been to see me and the other girls enjoying playing Barbies all winter, and how she just knew I'd have a wonderful 2nd grade and grow up to be a successful woman. Still have that book tucked away somewhere around here. Fast forward, I had two other especially amazing women; one was my 7th grade English teacher, the other my 9th grade history teacher. They're also best friends with each other. I practically clung to my English teacher throughout all of 7th and 8th grade. My history teacher knew everything about me and could recognize me the instant I walked into her class because my English teacher has told her all about me. Literally, I shook her hand on schedule night and before I opened my mouth she says, \"You must be ManDuh_B!\" I'm 13 years out of high school and still friends with these ladies. I guess I don't have a particular one moment with them because there are so many moments. But the last time all three of us had lunch a couple years ago, my history teacher looked at me during a lull in conversation and said, \"I am so proud of you. I always knew you were going to grow up to be an amazing woman.\" My family is not particularly proud of me. My in laws don't especially like me. Knowing that there are at least a couple people, who helped shaped probably thousands of mind during their long careers, who are proud of me kind of makes that all ok.",

We had a quiz, and I couldn't figure out how to factor polynomials. It just didn't make sense. So, I turned it in knowing I'd get a 0 or a 2 of 10 on the quiz. He just looked at me and said, \"No, I won't accept that. Try again.\" He believed I could do it, and instead of yelling, screaming, or anything else, he simply pulled up a chair and sat down with me and explained, step by step, how to do the two questions on the quiz. It really helped me learn a lot, not just in math, but as a person. He was a complete hardass of a teacher, so to see him break his shell and care enough about my success as a student instead of just a name in the classroom really helped. And now I can still, 15+ years later, factor polynomials. Mr. S who taught Physics and Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry, thank you.",

My band director heard, and he immediately asked me to come into his office, alone. I did, and he sat me down and asked me why I stay with him. He was usually a very funny, dry humor sarcastic guy, but he was dead serious. He told me that I deserve better, that he treated me horribly, that I shouldn't be with someone so mean and nasty to me. I didn't know what to say, but this was the first time I felt a teacher, nay, any male adult ever was looking out for me and cared about me. It resonated deeply with me, and I still think about it. I dumped the guy by the end of my junior year, best decision I made in high school to be honest.

There was also a bird and later on she would bring this kitten in she found after this one tornado/thunderstorm. Over holiday breaks she would let us take one of the animals home. Everyone had wanted the bird (she was a cockatoo and rosie cheeks was her name because well she had roses cheeks). Over winter break I was lucky enough to be able to take her home in her cage and everything. When I got home with the bird my Mom helped me carry her up into my room and set her on my night stand. After we had gotten the bird situated I went down stairs to flip on the tv and watch spongebob on the couch. A few minutes into watching spongebob there was a loud crash that came from upstairs. I jumped off the couch and ran upstairs I had met my mom at the top of the stairs also running towards my room. We had shared the \"Oh shit what the fuck was that\" look. At the time we had a black cat and shortly after we had shared that glance came the black cat running out of the room. Luckily Rosie didn't die (Thank god imagine all the kids in my class that would've straight up murdered me). Her cage was completely dismantled laying on the ground while she was perched on top of it. My mom began to clean it up while I was handling the bird. All was well for the rest of the break and nothing else significant happened. When we came back to school about a week later the bird had died. Me and my mother still joke about how we have the bird a heart attack.",

I've seen him doing countless selfless things that at the time I thought was cool for a math teacher, but today I realize how incredible the guy was * Offered free weekend classes to anyone willing. He'd invite a few of us at his place, give us advices and everything, and best part was his wife would make us dinner and wouldn't accept we leave before eating it haha. Eventually everyone wanted to go just for the food because Moroccan food is superb. I'm of Algerian descent myself and they felt like family. It just felt like I was visiting an uncle or something. (before any ill-intended American redditor comes at me: this was in France, a country where an adult talking to a kid doesn't immediately scream pedophile) * Spotted the few kids who were from a very poor family and would put extra effort towards helping them. Invited them to join him for lunch and he always had extra sandwiches or stuff for them. He told us he asked his wife if she could make some extra to make sure no one in school ever has to skip lunch. Asked that if any of us is in need or knows someone in need, we should ask him. Well in fact some kids took advantage of this, but he obviously knew, and didn't mind. It felt like... He just wanted to share something with kids * He honestly wasn't a rich guy at all, but didn't care about making more money. He loved sharing knowledge and teaching kids. Often told us how he was from a very poor Moroccan village and somehow made it. He'd run \"wagers\" with students. \"If you can solve that exercise for next time I'll give you 10EUR\". Well I can tell you people would work extra hard. 10 euros for a 12 year old poor kid was a fortune. I used to do an equivalent of spelling bees and got qualified to the regional finals which were a two-hour drive away. My parents couldn't help me for that. My math teacher actually took me there (note: at this point he was closer to us. My mom invited him and his wife for lunch a couple of times lol). I unfortunately didn't do well but to this day I can't believe you'd do that * I remember once, he helped one of the... \"troubled kids\" in my class. He was this kind of kid staying outside at all times, frequenting thugs etc. A common thing in the neighborhood was drug dealers would ask kids to run errands for them, because cops don't really check 12 years old kids - and you can give \u20ac10 to the kid and he'll be happy about it, right? Well this kid got caught once. And he told the police that... the math teacher was his dad. Too scared of his parents' reaction I guess. Teacher went to the police station to pick him up. He called the kid's parents to join him but they were \"busy\" and basically signed something for him to be legally allowed to pick the kid up. He did, and personally took him home, talked to his parents etc. This kid was never the same again. He saw more than a teacher, he saw someone who was ready to go through all efforts to make sure his life gets better. He became way more serious at school, started getting good grades, avoided the street etc. What a teacher. I don't think I've ever met someone remotely as genuinely interested in helping kids as this guy. I wish I could see him again some day",

For someone to have so much passion for a subject like english or science that they want to teach it they are definitely going to be a bit nerdy about it too. I feel for the teachers who were a little 'too eccentric' though. We had this one teacher in high school who was very outspoken and a little odd at times. It also didn't help that she was this little 5\" tall pudgy woman with frizzy hair and thick round glasses. In grade 9 I heard a bunch of rumors of her freaking out on students here and there in the past, with the most notable being that she threw a chair at a student. But when I finally had her, I realized she was just very eccentric and so a lot of students didn't take her seriously, so they would provoke her and disregard her authority more than any other, which would of course make her visibly frustrated, which would make the shitheads do it more. I also learned that she had just gone through a divorce with one of the other teachers, and so all of the stress from that was understandably getting compounded with the shit she got from students. Hell seeing the way some students treated her I probably would have thrown a chair if I were her too.",

One example was before one of my teachers came into the classroom, one of the more dumb kids thought it would be funny to draw a giant penis across the entire chalkboard (like 30 feet long). The teacher walks in, just erases the only part of the penis to write down what he needs for his lesson and goes on to each class. Doesn't even mention that there is a giant penis on the board for the whole class period. I guess he figured there was no reason to make it an issue if it didn't need to be one. Mad respect.",

I had no concept of whether I was bright or not, but I took a test that summer to see which classes I should be in and never thought anything of it. I took classes and didn't even know there were different levels of classes. Then after a month, my parents got a call saying that I had tested very well but they wanted to observe me for a month before putting me in the TAG program. I had no idea I was being observed. So after a month of being in this new school, I had all new classes with all new teachers. In the TAG English class we read one book as a class together and then another that we chose, and I chose The Boggart. The teacher came up while I was reading it and whispered, \"You know they're reading that in the regular level class, don't you?\" She didn't make it sound like I *had* to read a different book, but I became very self conscious. Then we got a student teacher who I *loved*. I could kind of tell the teacher was upset at how I sort of flourished with the student teacher, who had us read The Bronze Bow, which I loved. She got my sense of humor. We had to do different types of writing, including a how-to manual, and I wrote one on how to catch the school bus. It's the type of thing the regular teacher would have rolled her eyes at, but the student teacher liked. At the end of the year, the teacher (not the student teacher), said to me, \"You got an A every quarter right?\" I honestly had no idea. I had never paid attention to grades before that (in my elementary school we got Es and Ss, and I just knew that I had Es and Ss). I said I wasn't sure. She answered, \"Stop fooling around.\" I guess she thought I was trying to be modest. It turned out this school had an end of the year awards ceremony, which my schools never had before. And there was an award for getting an A in every quarter in every subject, which I got. I already had severe OCD. I still remember being on stage getting that award and in this internal voice that almost sounds demonic in how solemn and flat of affect it was, I said to myself, \"I have to do this every quarter for the rest of school now.\" It wasn't particularly healthy (because I went from not really knowing what my grades were to obsessing about them). The social class I was in became so cut-throat over GPA (best friends secretly taking college classes starting in 8th grade to boost their GPA, getting excuses to get out of taking gym because non-weighted courses would lower their GPA, etc.) that by the time I graduated my class was the one that convinced the school board to create GPA caps. I later found out that this 6th grade English teacher had taught some of my classmates when they were in elementary school before I moved there (they would come to the middle school to take classes from her so that by the time they started middle school they could take high school classes).",

With the marble we had to construct a way to keep it rolling for as long as possible, which represented water. Some combination of these two later and however well we did would determine if we produced enough to keep our population alive. If we didn't, then someone \"died\". Naturally, some nations are more resource poor than others, and there was also a fairly shitty \"war\" mechanic. (I say shitty, because given two countries rich enough, you'd just fire back and forth forever.) Anyway, most of my many group members in China weren't interested in actually playing so I set myself up as the head water engineer. By the end of the game I was the de facto leader of China because the guy who was our \"ambassador\" (aka the guy who ran around to the other group's tables to negotiate and do diplomacy) would always come back to run things by the group for approval, and I was pretty much the only one voicing an opinion. We were also in an endless war with the US where neither of us could get the upper hand. I have no idea what the point of that exercise actually was. It was a class on designing interactive museum exhibits and things like that. But it was a lot of fun to play, lol.",

If you finished one paper, you got a bonus point, but the nobles got a tax of half a point for every sheet finished, so you only got half a bonus point.

I remember only 2 other groups actually finished their video, and when we presented ours the whole class was laughing their ass off including the teacher. We actually ended up including some relatively raunchy shit, but he didn't get us in trouble for it and asked if we could make a more 'appropriate' cut of it so he could show the teachers during one of their meetings. Unfortunately, the principal found the other version, which we had uploaded to YouTube, and was not happy with us. He made me sign into my YT account in his office and delete it because it 'represented the school wrong' even though there was literately nothing in the video or description that referenced it being a school project. Anyway, I could go on about that for ages. I kind of hated that principal, but it was great to have a creatively nourishing teacher. I ended up just [reuploading the video like a month later anyway...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiBrBMuXVLM)",

No dumb words like dumb, but don't over embellish with words. **Remove passive voice from all of your writing**. Instead of saying \"the ball was thrown by Billy\" just say that Billy threw the ball. It decreases wordiness and helps flow. This is biggest thing I learned, and it's certainly not easy. Microsoft Word has options under its proof reader to look for passive voice. Structure. Is this actually needed? What is the purpose of each paragraph and each sentence in the paragraphs. You'll be surprised how useless some shit is. It also helps against redundancy. Be concise. You generally won't have ridiculous word limits so you don't need to over emphasize or elaborate too much on shit. Get what you want to say onto the page. Make it make sense. Have someone read it. Do I need to say more about that? Also, don't be afraid to destroy and have to completely rewrite what you were working on. A good paper has more in common with a work of art. It needs to be worked on, molded, an adapted before it's a finished piece. Source: in college and took a year of writing classes",

A thesis statement contains a topic, an opinion and generalized reasoning for that opinion. Schools should not cut music programs because x,y and z. Contraception coverage should be required by law in insurance plans because a, b, and c. GMOs are evil because q, r, and s. Then you take those three bits of generalized reasoning in each statement and expand on them a lot. Treat them as little mini thesis statements and come up with subtopics. Boom. You have a paper that keeps expanding and expanding. Even if your thesis is not fantastic (like the GMO one) you can at least have a paper that has structure and logic which is coherent and holds the paper together. This works for narrative style papers also: This event changed my life because a, b, and c. I enjoy my major because x, y, and z. Now, these are pretty formulaic thesis statements, but once you get the idea of putting a topic together with an opinion and providing some general reasoning for it, you can start writing statements that sound a little more unique but still, in the end, do what they need to do. It is REALLY unlikely that a great thesis statement is going to just fall out onto the page as soon as you start writing. you may have a crummy one that you need to reshape and rewrite several times. I have spent a lot of time just restructuring the wording on a thesis statement to be clear and concise. I usually write it by hand on a sheet of paper and then just keep rewriting it, like Bart Simpson on the chalkboard but with edits each time. ",

When you want to get really hammered, you want your drink to have as much concentrated alcohol as possible, like a shot. Adding extra fluff words and such to try to sound smart is actually like watering down your drink, and makes your writing less potent. So the idea is to try to use as few words as possible to convey an idea, to maintain the potency of the idea. For example, I'm looking at a picture of a random kid's essay that was posted because it had to do with Skyrim, but it's a great example of this concept. The part of the essay that is in the picture reads \"...the best games are the ones where my personality works in tandem with the gameplay to give me enjoyment out of things that I can only get from this medium.\" You can tell he's trying too hard to sound smart, by using as many words as possible to convey his message and throwing some fancy words in there. In reality, he's watering it down and so that sentence lacks potency. Although I don't know what the beginning of that sentence was, something like \"games that coincide with my personality provide the best platform for pleasure\" would convey what he was saying in a more potent and readable manner.",

I had her when she was a new teacher, and she was THE BEST - very full of life and with incredibly interesting lessons. We built a guillotine and a gallows when we were studying the French Revolution and the North-West Rebellion, using barbies as the victims! She got me enthused about French language and Canadian history. Everyone loved her. Fast-forward a couple years and a friend's sibling is ranting about how she's always grumpy and they never do anything fun. I could hardly believe it! I always still said hi to her in the halls and she did look a little less bubbly, but I knew she was having a few health problems and she always smiled warmly and responded. Story came out a bit later (small town) that on top of the health problems, her husband had been cheating on her and asked her for a divorce when they were out for Valentines Day dinner. He kept the house and their beloved dog, and she got to go in to work feeling alone and broken and face off with lively, romance obsessed 8th graders. No wonder she was grumpy. Things did eventually improve for her and she remarried, but I don't know if she ever got back to being the joyous, fun loving teacher that had such an impact on me. I hope she did. I am a teacher now, and honestly it scares me to think about how quickly all that joy was sucked away. When you're teaching and you're upset there's nowhere to hide, and it makes it worse when there are kids who sense that you're injured and think it's funny to put fingers in the wound. Jr high is not characterized by human compassion, that's for sure. ",

Then, one week, you turn up and the teacher is suddenly talking about Wuthering Heights. Even more than that, the teacher picks up from a point halfway through the novel as if the class had been about WH all along. You *know* this is wrong but the teacher still goes on about WH; you try to tell him that you'd spent the past several weeks reading about 1984 (not WH) but he says he doesn't know what you're talking about, you've all been reading about WH. That is what OP is getting at: the teacher is illustrating this point (which is an integral part of understanding 1984) by performing it in class. Perhaps the most famous espousal of this in the book is \"Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.\" That is, how the party changed allegiances and enemies and then maintained that they had always been that way. Everyone *knows* that it wasn't always this way, but they are so scared to speak out about that they stay silent and go along with the deception.",

We never really disrupted class, we always paid attention, we contributed thoughtful and meaningful discussion when asked to, and consistently scored well enough on AP and IB exams for the teachers to get a bonus check. I can't think of many parents that would complain unless the teacher was truly being unfair and failed a majority of the class. The one teacher who was frequently reported was my IB Pre-Calc teacher in 10th grade. He was a new guy, expected way too much from us since we were supposedly the \"brightest kids in the county,\" and was just filled with disappointment when he learned that we weren't absorbing his information. The sad thing is that he, like you mentioned, had all these fresh and new ideas to get his students engaged and learning, but I guess it just never went off for him since he wasn't exactly the best teacher. He eventually got fired and I felt really bad for him :/ though it made me feel better that this was just his retirement job and he was only in it because he loved teaching. However, many of the dedicated teachers there have been there for decades (despite having Masters or Ph.Ds in marketable fields), and one of them even taught my friend's parents. But there's a negative side as well. My school has a separate IB program that mainly attracts wealthier kids with privileged backgrounds from the other side of town, while the regular \"Major Program\" is filled with hundreds of disadvantaged Black kids from the Ghetto. Our school published statistics and about 72% of the students live in poverty, and a large amount of those students fill up these statistics. In fact, the only reason why the IB program was put in this school in particular was because it was doing so poorly that it almost shut down until an IB program was installed and its ratings skyrocketed over the next 30 years. No one really wants to say anything, but the major program teachers definitely have it worse. My IB Biology teacher taught 2 major program classes, and one day when I stayed over to do a lab, I noticed that they were probably the most ill-behaved kids I've ever seen. They were ignoring the teacher, talking in class, and playing with their phones. I could tell that my teacher had basically given up with that class and just put random biology videos on for them to watch, which was opposed to the enthusiasm and activeness she showed when she taught her IB students. On the other side of the hall, we always heard the HL IB Chemistry teacher screaming at her misbehaved major program class as they continued rambling. The AP/IB teachers are paid more than the regular students according to one of my teachers, and as a result a lot of the major program teachers end up leaving after a few years since I'm assuming they don't want to put up with the disrespect and low pay. Even then, the IB teachers aren't exactly paid the best salary and occasionally we have teachers leave for better opportunities. I know this goes a bit off topic but my school basically shows how screwed up the education system is. Most of the schools' resources and funding went towards the IB kids, and we even received personal MacBooks when pretty much all of us had a few computers back at home, as opposed to some Major Program kids who didn't even have Internet access or food when they returned home. I feel as if most Major Program teachers hate their job there seeing as most quit after a few years. It's a never-ending cycle. The kids are most likely misbehaving because they were subject to bad influences growing up, and as a result they come into class unmotivated and uncaring, which angers and demoralizes the teachers, and in turn he/she doesn't put as much effort into helping these kids. Most of these kids go to a local community college or directly into the workforce after graduating, whereas ALL of the IB kids go to a university, and at least the top 10-20% of the IB class ends up going to an Ivy League or highly ranked school, whereas the rest attend top-50 universities. Due to the advantages that the IB kids have, there's still a lot of de facto segregation and discrimination at my school. Both programs don't really interact with each other, and IB kids tend to make jokes about the Major Programs' disadvantages. It doesn't even extend to the students, as there was a substitute-teacher that trash talked the Major Program kids and loudly voiced his opinions of how \"dumb those kids are.\" (He didn't get fired since nobody reported him). A few years ago my school tried implementing this integration program to help connect the IB with the Major Program, but it failed horribly since like I said before, nobody wanted to interact and IB kids remained with IB kids and MP remained with MP.

If you get a job at a \"good\" school, or at least not one filled with poverty, you tend to have better kids, who are more prepared, have supportive and active parents. They enjoy their job, and they stay. If you get a job in a \"bad\" school, you have so many outside influences to deal with before the kids even get to your classroom. As you mentioned, they don't have food at home. Parents are absent (physically or emotionally, but due to trying to keep a roof over their heads). They aren't active. The pressures on teachers are higher since the school is likely failing anyway. On top of that, kids just aren't as well prepared. For example, I taught 8th grade math. Most of my kids came in at 6th grade level or below. Yet, I was supposed to be teaching them grade level curriculum. And when they didn't pass the grade level curriculum, it was my fault. Why would someone dealing with that want to stay?",

Teachers don't have a social security or 401k, most just have their pension. So of course you are going to stay until you can get that pension, because otherwise you have no retirement. I also think people are a lot quicker to tell teachers to \"get out\" of their job than they are to tell other professions that are burnt out. Other people just hear, just deal with it until retirement or something similar once they've been there a while. But they expect teachers to be these martyrs that put everyone else's needs above their own. That's not really fair.",

Get that shit out of here and use passive. We're introducing more crap we have to explain that we actually don't care one whit about, and we can avoid all that headache with passive. Newspapers frequently use passive when focused on, say, a recent accomplishment of a team of, say, scientists. You want the focus to be on the accomplishment (let's use the LHC). A lot of sentences can use active voice, but some - such as when it was constructed - basically require passive voice (LHCs don't build themselves, y'know). In an article all about the LHC, \"Scientists and engineers built the LHC in (year)\" feels out of place. Also, as a linguist(ish), there's literally no reason to ever believe that a distinct feature of a language should be avoided (and passive voice again).",

I know that more often than not, the rudeness is unintentional due to ignorance, but it doesn't stop my self esteem from crashing to the ground, causing me to question my self-worth and allowing my anxiety to build up until I'm fully convinced that I'm as stupid and worthless as many people seem to think.

When I changed him again, he got himself stuck in between the front seats of the car and proceeded to have mustard yellow diarrhea pouring out of the top of his diaper all over the car and he didn't understand what was happening so he kept wiping it with his hands and then frantically grabbing the seats because he was stuck. Before anyone judges me, he's autistic and non-verbal so keeping him out of things or potty training is a lot harder. The poop happened in a matter of seconds while my back was turned to talk to my friend as we were getting ready to leave. The duck bits are at her house and I didn't even know any of it was there until he ran directly to it and dove in.

The driver lets them on, and they spend a little while trying to get themselves sorted out and begin fumbling for their wallet and finding the right change. Bonus points if they start asking questions that could easily be answered by looking at the bus - \"Is this the one to the city center?\". Yes. It says 'city center' in bigass letters on the front. -_- &nbsp; As they just about get their ticket, another late runner arrives and does exactly the same thing - once had a chain of at least (no exaggeration) five people do this. Eventually the bus has been there long enough that people who are early for the next bus start arriving at the stop. \"Ooh\" they think, \"The earlier bus is running late. I can get on that one instead of waiting for the next!\". They board and whilst they start buying a ticket, more people begin to arrive - a mix of latecomers and early birds. Congratulations assholes, now the bus is running late. &nbsp; At some point the driver has to call it and move on. Essentially the bus full of people is being held up by a handful of individuals who couldn't get their ass to the stop on time. It's why I prefer to take the train if its an option. The doors shut at a scheduled time, and if you're late... tough. &nbsp; Yes, I've been slightly late for a bus before.

Sheriff took 45 minutes to show up, so I was able to calm down and have the back pain reported in the police report. I went to the chiro 15 times in the last 4 months and had an MRI done since the pain wasn't getting better two months later.

One winter I was getting terrible tonsilitis/throat infections and ended up absolutely losing my voice, couldn't make a sound for a couple of days at a time. A couple of times I had to go to the pharmacy with a note I'd written basically saying \"Hi, sorry about this but I've completely lost my voice. Could I have [some pharmacy stuff] please?\" and hand it across the counter. I recall the deep sense of embarrassment and frustration I felt when one of the women read my note and then gave me this big kind smile and started talking to me slowly and loudly and making big hand gestures. There was a queue of a few people behind me and I was looking around, like, \"lady, I've got a sore throat, not a brain injury\". I'd made it quite clear what I wanted on the note but she kept on asking me super-slow questions about what I wanted. I couldn't answer at all and tried to make that clear. Eventually I took the note back from her and was pointing to the things on it and then to the things on the shelf. She didn't seem to understand that I was capable of understanding what I needed. I eventually got a pen and wrote on the back of the note \"Sorry, is there anybody else here I could speak to?\" That seemed to confuse her but someone else appeared and I got my throat spray and painkillers. That single incident was so embarrassing and humiliating and frustrating... I can't imagine having to be half-prepped for something like that to happen to me at any time and for no reason, just as a part of my day. I'll be honest, I find I get a bit self-conscious talking to or around deaf or hearing impaired people, purely because I know I need to be a bit aware that they are experiencing the conversation in a way that I don't ever experience it, and that I need to be prepared to adapt what I'm doing if they need it. I probably do speak a little more slowly and clearly (not in a patronising \"they won't be able to understand normal speech\" way, just in an \"I'm aware that I often mumble a lot\" way). But then maybe that ends up feeling patronising. :/ Damn, man. I'm really sorry. I honestly think that most of us really never consider what it might be like to have a permanent sensory impairment, and in one way that makes us incredibly lucky, but in another way it makes us incredibly narrow in our thoughts and manner.",

He took it from my hands immediately and did something near the neck and the sound stopped. Although I was sad, he explained to me that the cat could have lived in pain for a lot longer, and the best thing to do was to put the cat out of the misery we technically caused. After that, I made sure no cats went near the top barn door when we threw haybails into the barn. I was like 10-11 at this time. Yes, I cried. ",

In my country college is free but you in order to enter one every student must pass exams. There are 3 different \"paths\" you can go in high school each having different exams (physics-maths-cs, chemistry-biology-maths, literature-etc-etc). Depending on the exams you can apply to different colleges. Each college accepts a certain number of students each year. For example my college for the computer science department accepted the year i entered 120 students. The top 120 students that applied for the college got in. Its highly competitive and rarely do people go to colleges they dont want or that the drop out of. All in all this is a highly effective system. Everyone who is determined and hardworking can get college education for 0 cost, not even textbooks. The students in each class want to be there and have very good base knowledge due to the competitive nature of the exams. Well at least for the mid to high end class colleges. Lower end colleges to be easier and of lower standard but offer a good degree and knowledge non the less. This system is by no means perfect but is a very good standard in my opinion. Everyone has a chance with no money or anything else needed. Plus free education raises society's educational level which is always a good thing",

You have to first take a vocational test to see what you would excel at. You could only apply to colleges (engineering, art, medicine, etc) that the vocational test results said you'd be compatible with. Then take a test to apply for the college and depending on your results you'd be accepted. Furthermore, a specif test depending on what area of the college (if applicable) needed to be taken to make sure that you qualified (i.e. a particular engineering) and then you're in no problem. TL;DR: university is free, but they filter the shit out of you to make sure you won't waste resources. \\* Edit: Of course, your high school GPA matters, the higher it is, the more likely you are to be able to apply to the school of your choice. Public university is free and the education was really good, people whose GPA wasn't good enough could still apply, but wouldn't probably make it. People with higher GPAs had preference. There were still private universities that of course had a tuition that needed to be paid, and even then, The government offered to subsidized your education. All you had to do was apply for it and they would draw a certain number of winners in a lottery fashion kind of contest. ",

Making college free would simply lure an even greater number of marginal students into that trap. There isn't a really perceptible public good to shelling out further tens of thousands of dollars per student for another legion of marginal psychology and sociology majors. That said, it wouldn't surprise me to see a greater emphasis on subject-matter-specific scholarships in the future, to the point of making more in-demand skill sets (IT, health care, or whatever the future holds that may be different than where things stand now) *both* easier to major in *and* more lucrative after graduation.

To put it in perspective, this is a little more than the cost the U.S. [spent on food stamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program) last year. 2) **Many students who attend college never complete it.** For example, nearly [4 in 10 students](https://www.brookings.edu/research/should-policymakers-make-college-free-or-better-support-institutions/) at public four year colleges do not graduate. Of course, part of these low graduation rates might be costs. However, the sad reality is still that many students enter college educationally and socially underprepared. Free college won't change that, and that means that taxpayers will be footing the bill for students who will never graduate. 3) **It's essentially a redistribution of money to wealthy and middle class kids.** Ask yourself who the most likely people to attend college are. The answer, of course, are kids from families who are already pretty well off. Universal free college is ultimately un-progressive, because it would [disproportionately benefit those at the top half of the income distribution.](https://www.brookings.edu/research/who-would-benefit-most-from-free-college/) Of course, there are also reasons why free college may be good public policy which I have left uncovered -- I myself am torn on the issue.

That means that the average applicant will have to spend more time studying (and not working) to be admitted. If you're from a wealthy family, that isn't a huge problem. But if you're from a poorer family and you have to work to put food on the table, you might not be able to devote more time to studying.

Compare the average college student with the 1954 8th Grade Civics Test (below).

I believe the discussion of the cost of college or university is a loss leader. If our regular schools, that are largely funded by tax dollars, were set up to exceed the current expectations then the skill of the students leaving them would be as good or better than those we are currently graduation from our universities. The decline of public education also raises the question of how our university education would fare under a fully government (taxpayer) funded situation. Nobody wants to live in government housing if they can help it. Nobody enjoys the long wait at the DMV. Why should taking our education further in the direction of government control give us any reason to expect excellence? http://www.rense.com/general75/pass.htm One other point. Who ever said that the only way to have a successful life is to obtain a college degree? Does it help? That all depends on your chosen field. Don't let anyone else define your meaningful life for you. ",

People get bogus degrees, and areas that could actually use more people (the trades) are suffering for it, for no good reason but the fact that they require a different form of certification. The current system is blatantly wasting taxpayer money. Personally, I don't believe services should be taxpayer funded at all, but even if you do believe in taxpayer funded services, you recognize the issues with being forced to fund the lowest value of degrees while being deprived of the services you actually need *because* of it. Plus, what's going to happen when nobody can repay these loans, because they're working at Starbucks or McDonald's for the rest of their lives? If the market is more privatized, the institutions that offer worthless degrees will quickly go out of business, while the ones that offer good degrees will stay in business. Students who can't afford it on their own will have much better options in scholarships and private loans, as the public loan system goes out of business. There will be a better controlled market for what degrees are offered in and how many of those degrees are offered, such that the market isn't flooded in any one area, and will also help with saturation in areas that people previously didn't explore, but would because of the new system requiring them to consider alternative options.",

In Australia university used to be free and now you have a loan through the government that gets taken out of your pay like tax once you've met a threshold earning level. Access to education should be based on academic merit not wealth. So making education affordable doesn't mean take every student who thinks \"yeah why not\". We still have limits on places and for the most desirable subjects it is very difficult to get in. By limiting the places you aren't faced with issues of oversupply. In terms of people enrolling in education who shouldn't be there, having minimum requirements prevents this BUT there will always be people who hate school and end up not pursuing tertiary education, or who are hands on and pursue a trade. So does this mean the reasons not to make it free/govt subsidised are \"I didn't get/need this opportunity so why should others access it\" and/or \"I'm wealthy enough that this isn't my problem, fuck you poor people\"?",

Free tuition is a regressive policy. In other words, it benefits the rich more than the poor. Even when affordability isn\u2019t an issue, the upper and middle classes still participate in higher education at vastly higher rates than the lower classes. Free tuition hands wads of cash to those who attend university, even though many of them could have easily afforded it on their own. Meanwhile, the (disproportionately poor) group of people who don\u2019t attend receive nothing, but they\u2019re sure as shit asked to pay for it through their taxes. Net result: an upward transfer of wealth. Also consider the investment value of a degree. This isn\u2019t what it used to be, but depending on your degree and country, you can still expect to gross at least several hundred thousand dollars more in lifetime earnings than someone without a degree. This is the main reason people pursue higher education, and the main benefit\u2014society doesn\u2019t particularly need this many educated people. So if I\u2019m going to enjoy the dividends of that investment for the rest of my life, shouldn\u2019t I have to contribute *some part* of it instead of passing the whole cost on to everyone else? I already had a ton of advantages that allowed me to attend university in the first place (stability at home, extracurricular activities, primary education at a decent school, etc.). So why should I be handed this final advantage while people who didn\u2019t enjoy the same privileges and didn\u2019t make it to college get one last slap in the face by being denied the same cash handout? This same money (and it would be a *lot* of money) can be used in a much fairer, more targeted way. This means things like income- and skill-dependent scholarships, variable tuition rates, and investment in areas that help get disadvantaged kids ready for university in the first place, like early-life social and education programs.",

I realize that I have a much higher than normal IQ, but despite that, and taking it into account, there were way to many 'rich kids' at school that were just there to parts. In the whole grades, sleep, and good grades, and you get to pick two scenario. A lot of them ditched the grades thing, Or, in order to pander to getting students, the universities have bogus major that cater to not failing people (at my school, elementary education, business, marketing. The Greek life at the school gets to boast an 'average of a 3.8 GPA!, the only issue is that most of them are dumb as bricks, and complain when they have to put in .01 oz of effort. Example: business course taken as a minor. Group project required. Tried to schedule meetings durring the day. 30 minutes to work on something. Group members never showed. To ANY meeting. When they did, they never actually did any work. Just played on social media. (These were assigned groups) Put together a live working document, and agreed to split work (they also agreed) with deadlines to get together to review. Their parts were never done. The other engineering group member and I ended up doing most of the work, and got good grades, but the team mates actually complained to the professor that we didn't tell them about doing stuff, or working on things outside of group meeting times (as we were supposed to be doing. Professor looked at them funny and suggested we let them do more work) Next project, we established boundaries for work, and let them submit their sections. Resulting grade? - 72, and they were perfectly fine with it. The response? - We are passing and our parents don't care. 72 is the grade we get in engineering when we put 8 hours into each homework we get, and study even more for exams. And the 72 is the class average amongst smart people. The projects once we took back over and did work for the other members only after they missed deadlines, we were getting mid 90's on and putting in 10% of the effort of what we did for engineering. I realize the intelligence level is different, but the real issue to me is the fact that the average grades were the same, but for engineering we actually had to work for it. Like really work. And while the 72 was average, that usually was a 'B' (76-85 and above was usually above an A) And that fact makes me not want free education. Venture back to math and science or literature buildings, and you find passionate people hard at work much more often. Those people deserve scholarships. People who are held to a high standard, have to work for it, and strive to succeed are the ones who deserve our favor and money. The other side of the american culture, that expects a handout from the government, or daddy, can go right on and fuck off. People say teachers are not paid enough. I say their education is too lax, because of that too many people choose it to skate through school, because many of them do not get the MRS degree they want, they end up teaching and dilute the market with people who are not truly passionate. And once in the workforce their disgruntled attitude and nonchalantness of inspiring young kids rubs off, as well as they tend to be critical of teachers that perform well and 'make them look bad' Sorry for the long and random ADHD rant, but america has some serious issues in the educational industry. Many of which stem from for-profit universities (by that I mean all of them. Even public universities are increasing acceptance rates and have 'fluff' majors that don't get as good scholarships so they can afford to pay for research) ",

They can't even stick to it when the government is making them pay for it so why would they stick to it when the government is paying for it. EDIT: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_326.10.asp Great statistics from the National Center for Educational Statistics. While my initial number of 80% was wrong, it was not wrong by much. Go through these numbers and take a look at Public Institions. For 1996-2008, we had 26-34% of students actually graduating. Let me briefly give you an explanation of that so you can understand what these numbers actually mean. For an example I'll use my public community college, it's about $25,000 for a four year degree. We've got about 13,000 students on campus. To send all those people to school for 4 years for a bachelors, which let's face it, is more likely to be 5 years (we'll go with 4), comes out to $325,000,000. Let's take the average graduation rate of years 96-08 public instition rates and we get 31%. Now let's fast forward a bit. We'll imagine if out of those 13,000 students that 4,030 graduate (31%) and the rest (69%) dropped out. If we have some fun with math, we can say that it took $325 million to get those 4,030 kids through school. That would put them to the tune of $80,645 per degree. Now we've spent 322.58% more money to get those people an education. In reality though, what we did was waste $223 million dollars on those 8,920 students that did not complete school. Now these numbers are just for my local community college and assuming that nobody transfers. This doesn't account for books, it does not account for tacked on fees that the colleges get us for, and it does not count for the campuses that do provide dorms. Even though we don't know those figures, we do know that spending $325 million dollars to educate roughly 4,000 adults is a lot of money. It's not practical to see every single person going to college unless you tax the people into the stone ages. My question to you: Is it worth it? ",

We've got millions of kids in college that are essentially there because someone told them that's what they should do. More than half of those students never graduate. I don't want to fund a gamble we know we will be losing out of the gate and I doubt others do either. I would be down with a free college system that gives incentives to educational paths directed at filling much needed positions and reduces the incentives for majors with projected career paths into a flooded job market. Also, require students to have passing grades. As it stands, you need to be on academic probation to lose out on financial aid at a City College level. That can take a year or more of failing classes depending on the state. We need to hold peoples feet to the fire more in this aspect. ",

Only 1 out of 2 white children did. Is that what you'd like to go back to? Yes, some high schools - the ones where more affluent students went - had more challenging curricula than today; I've looked at my parents and grandparents transcripts. The curriculum was harder because by the time you got to 11th grade, mostly only the college-bound or skilled-trade bound were left. The rest had dropped out. As a result, high schools could teach Latin. > Today we graduate 9 of 10 white students and a little less than 7 of 10 minority students. The black graduation rate, in particular, has skyrocketed from what it was. > It's true that U.S. educational outcomes have stagnated since the early to mid 1970s. They haven't gone down, but they just haven't gotten better. The 1970s was also the post-civil rights era when most minority and/or poor children started staying in school instead of dropping out at age 14-17 to go to work. ",

I would have much rather received reduced financial aid and not have taken 9 units of classes that were pass/fail, but unfortunately the FAFSA system is outdated and it is usually an all or none scenario. My choices were: lose all my financial aid or take a couple fun but pointless classes and get $4,000/semester. What would you have done?",

As circular as it sounds, the value of a degree is determined by the value of the skills it teaches you to the marketplace.

And certainly the difficulty of the degree helps reduce the number of graduates, which pushes up the value, but it is not the only factor involved. If NASA were eliminated tomorrow, or if disease wiped out 90% of the population, rocket science would be just as hard of a degree, but it would become much less valuable to the marketplace and would earn much less. Another example is computer science (which I majored in). I would say that computer science is about equally difficult to other engineering degrees. (It might even be slightly easier than other engineering degrees). But a computer science degree commands more money in the marketplace than (most) other engineering degrees. Why? Because the software industry is much younger than civil engineering or aerospace (especially in it's recent forms). It is still experiencing growth far beyond the other engineering disciplines. (All this is for now of course). My bet is that in 50 years, a computer science degree will be worth about the same or perhaps a little less than other engineering degrees.",

The amount of people \"currently working on completing my masters degree\" is almost crazily unheard of. Is the Master's Degree becoming the new Bachelor's Degree? Like...more education is great, but holy crap...is this going to be the new standard? Just to add to my anecdote here of just how \"skewed\" things are becoming. I recently saw a posting at Coca-Cola for a regional sales/distribution account representative - A semi-skilled position that at face value, I would peg it at \"intermediate fringing on advanced\" career level position. As in, The second rung or maybe even third rung climbing the career ladder. They were looking for 10 years experience and a MINIMUM of a Master's Degree. Now...where does my credibility to make a critical assessment of this position? Well, I work in HR and went to school for HR - I've done some workforce planning in my short career and have an understanding of the status quo in an organization. To me, they were asking executive level qualifications for a role that is \"experienced, not entry level\". Finally, to dabble in my career a little bit...I've had a few postings up looking for various entry level skilled jobs (like Civil Engineers). The amount of \"Master's Degrees\" that come across my desk looking for entry level is concerning too...and I'm sorry to say it, but they screen themselves out...People are \"over-qualifying themselves\". \"How can you make that judgement based on a resume? that's so unfair! this is why we hate HR\"...well, before you cast me aside and bury me, understand I don't just select resumes - I go through them with who would be your manager, we both make a mutual decision based on the candidates qualifications. We usually agree that, when we see a Master's Degree - and we're only asking for a diploma - that they're not going to stick it out with us, besides, a lot of what is talked about in this thread is \"value\" - If you were a Master's Degree graduate and we offered you A diploma's graduate salary, wouldn't you feel a little \"undervalued?\". Again, anecdotally, my first \"real job\" paid me basically the equivalent of $12/hr American. Its not a great starting salary, considering a bunch of positions in the hotel I worked for (front desk, bell desk) were paying the USD equivalent of $11/hr...When I really was hoping I'd get something to the tune of $16USD (or $20ish Canadian which is where my conversions come from) - Again, call me entitled or whatever, but was too much to ask that after graduating I could make a decent salary? Its not like $20/hr would have me \"rolling in the riches\" or barely even \"ability to live comfortably\". ANYWAY...This is a long post... **TL;DR** While further improving yourself through the pursuit of education is overall not a bad thing, I think we all, collectively, need to set realistic expectations of \"how the world works\". Oh well, just try your best, don't be afraid to fail and don't see things as a \"negative\" as in, there is only long-term benefits to acquiring a Masters or Bachelors...it may take you awhile to get on your feet.

For the mother that works 2 jobs and has 3 kids- that's 1000/yr. She can't afford that. So then the argument pivots and says that she won't have to pay those 4 shares and her portion gets shifted onto others. As the shares of the (fixed income)elderly, disabled, poorest, and children get redistributed that pool to divide the cost get a lot smaller. Lets say that pool is now the 122 million tax paying individuals. That 122 million includes people who pay the lowest tax brackets. The new number is 614 per year by the way- that's a lot for people in the 10-15% federal tax bracket. Those are single people who make less than 37k/yr, married folks who's combined income is 75k/yr and head of households who make 50k/yr. So lets remove them from the pool and say they're exempt too. ~99 million households. Now we have ~23 million households left. I'm now on the hook for $3260/yr indefinitely. That stings. I could keep going and eventually we would end up with the highest tax bracket households (~1 million) each footing the bill of 75k/yr forever. This group includes people who make 400k/yr and already pay nearly 40% of that back to government. This would be an *additional* 75k tax on their already existing tax bill.

There's no downward pressure, there's no mix of private and subsidized loans a student won't sign. 3) This was all well and good when state school systems were well-funded but pinched and increasingly conservative legislatures have been axing those budgets to the bone. This exerts further upward pressure. 4) Competing for this free money and talented (and full-pay students), private universities have been turning their campuses into playgrounds, which puts pressure on public universities to follow suit. Further upward pressure. Frame the debate not as \"I should go to college without paying\" but \"I am willing to pay higher taxes so that there is a pathway for qualified people who do not have social or economic capital to achieve their potential. As I depend on these people, whether I have children or not, to fund my social security and medicaid, it seems reasonable that we have at least one reverse pyramid scheme\" Maybe some blend of the following: A) Replace the taxpayer backstop on student loans with a shall-issue ~$10K/yr voucher. To receive these vouchers, schools must pass accreditation standards and cap tuition for all students at, say, $15,000/year (downward pressure) B) End un-dischargability of student debt to restrict credit and induce further downward pressure C) A downside of the capped tuition and restricted credit is that schools will need to cut nice-to-haves, like state-of-the-art dining halls and residence halls. You're 18, you can sleep two-to-a-room and slum it a bit. That's your side of the trade-off. Undergraduate facilities are fucking insane. D) Service requirement for using the voucher for students. Think GI bill. 1 year pre, 1 year-equivalent post. End the system of young-adult-day-care currently in place. Everyone I know who was out in the world for a year before matriculating took a very, very different approach to school and crushed it. E) I do not think it appropriate to limit to STEM, etc. There's already plenty of incentive to go into those fields for those who are capable, and Finance will siphon off the difference makers anyway.

I love learning. i love the feeling that comes with knowing things. but it's not hard to see that large swaths of the school system are utter bullshit. a lot of the time i get the feeling that when people excel, they're doing it in spite of the system rather than because of it. but you didn't come to me to ask about politics, you came to ask about how the hell to survive school. well i can only speak personally, but i'm the sort of person who would have learned things whether i was in school or not. i taught myself how to use DAWs and the basics of sound synthesis. i taught myself photoshop. animation. how carburetors work. i've always been trying to learn things, so for me, i was able to look at university as a way for me to get easy knowledge. after all, you just sit your ass down in lecture and they hand that shit out! it was great! **while i hated the system itself, i liked what i managed to take from it** that's really what it boils down to. i wasn't staying in college because i had made friends i liked, i wasn't staying there because of a fraternity or sports team, *i stayed there because college put me in proximity to experts whose knowledge i wanted to have*. and let me be honest, it sucked. at times it *really* sucked. i'm not one of those people who looks back on his college days and glows in effervescent reminiscence. i made it through college because i could learn things quickly there and i liked how it felt to learn and know things. that was my motivation. it helped that my majors were two fields i wanted to know *just to know them*. i didn't have an end-game for most of my college career. i wasn't going to uni \"to become\" something, i was there just \"to learn\" something. if that makes sense. so just the simple act of being there was enough to start fulfilling the goals i had for going there in the first place. it wasn't, \"i'm going here to be a translator, and i can do that in four years,\" it was, \"I'm going here to learn Japanese, and *i'm doing that right now.*\" honestly i think that instant process-based fulfillment was a large part of what helped keep me there. but maybe that won't work for you. in fact, i'd hazard a guess that it probably won't. you seem to have gone in with a specific endgame in mind. you seem to have gone in to college \"to become\" something. so capitalize on that. trade on knowledge-futures, if you will. find out what topics you need to learn to become the kind of engineer you're aiming for (do you need to know fluid dynamics? what about CAD? Chip architecture?). make a checklist of that shit, check off the stuff you've learned, add bonus checkboxes for mastery of a topic. you're an engineer, you know math; calculate how long until you're outta there and make a countdown calendar. anything to remind yourself that you are becoming more of an engineer day by day and soon, soon enough, these days of forcing yourself to class will be behind you. in other words, do everything you can to make it about the process, not the endgame. hope that helps.",

That just makes poor folks stuck without a degree and not being able to do jobs that require a degree! I'm not saying there isn't a problem, but this isn't the way to fix this. On that note, the value of a degree is certainly NOT about how much someone paid, but about whether said person can do his job. If someone graduates with a medical degree, it doesn't matter how much he paid for college if he can't treat my illness. He should only be allowed to be a doctor if he can do his job.

IIRC they have done this here in Canada before.

Sure if I was a top tier desk engineer maybe, but I've talked to those people and they admit they use about 10% of what they have learned in school, the rest is basic algebra which I'm done with. My problem is finding motivation to learn stuff I'll never use, which seems to be the majority of my classes. I also don't have a goal, there is no engineering position I want specifically. The only reason I picked it is because it's my hobby and greatest interest. These hard classes just seem to be here to keep me from being able to do what I love, not enable me. I don't know how to get myself to turn that thought around. I guess I feel as though I don't need the classes to be an engineer, I already am one. But society wants a piece of paper to prove that, I'm rebellious I guess. ",

I work with a few clients who, under the REPAYE plan, barely pay more than the interest accrued each month.

If, on the other hand, you were to choose the 10-year repayment plan, then you would effectively gain no benefit from the forgiveness.",

Entry level jobs which never care about your degree type (just it's existence proving you have the kind of real world experience that limits the amount of training and handholding the company has to do with each employee and gaurantees a basic skill level) could then only require this new AGS degree as the baseline meaning we still have an educated workforce.

I took a sculpture course. I don't even *do* sculpture. i took a psychology course about blind dudes echolocating and how sommeliers taste stuff so well. *completely useless!* i'm not a goddamned physical therapist! ...but they kept me from getting bored and they fulfilled some of the meaningless little course requirements i needed to walk away with my degree. that's literally all those courses are for. use them. college won't stop being useless and awful until *you* make it worth something to you. universities--american universities--aren't there to make you a good adult. they're there to take your money and give you a piece of paper that identifies you as 'someone who can finish something.' *You're* the one who has to make uni worth something to you, because it's not going to do it on its own.",

He then spent almost two years taking remedial classes (many of which he failed and had to retake). He's changed his major at least 5 times, each time to something he considered *easier.* I think that he's now a General Studies major. So yeah... Not everyone is cut out for college, until it comes to *their* kids. No one wants to be the parents whose child couldn't cut it in college, because apparently that means they're worthless to society (which isn't true at all).",
