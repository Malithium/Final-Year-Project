I honestly don't know why the teacher didn't just shut it down right then and explain the horror of dying terribly on a beach halfway around the world and wanting nothing in that moment than to be with your mother.

And everyone, even the hotel desk clerk, decides that it's ok to fuck with the memory guy for their own personal gain. And the structure and non-linear storytelling are outstanding and completely original. There's almost nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before, but every single thing feels completely new.

After watching it, all my preconceptions were turned on their heads. Every single minute detail of that film was geared to add to the themes. The characterization was brilliant, the symbolism ran a mile deep, and the composition of every 'shot' was so precisely done. I could honestly go on and on. The use of color, light and darkness, the cultural undertones... it just really blew me away.

With Ex Machina I found myself thinking a lot about what Ava really wanted for herself- did she have affection for Caleb but just not enough to go through the effort of rescuing him and endangering her own escape (similarly to how a human might feel about a pet hamster or something)? Did she have malicious feelings toward him? Did she really just have no feelings whatsoever? Or are her emotions and motivations beyond what we as humans can possibly understand. With *Her* I found myself thinking a lot about what the AIs were doing when they weren't talking to humans. What did they talk about among themselves? Did they even \"talk\" as we would think of it? How did they relate to the emotions that they'd been set up by their human creators to have? Where did they go in the end?

This ends up leaving a lot of mystery to what is actually going on, which makes the movies far more memorable, at least to me. Also, the alternate reality games, if you kept up with them, made the movie so much more enjoyable. I was too young at the time to really pay much attention to the Cloverfield one, but I kept up with the game for 10 Cloverfield Lane. It was really great seeing how all the clues and little snippets of information we were given became relevant or actually showed up in the film, and how much more meaning they had when given context. It also gives you some backstory on John Goodman's character and his family. The fact that it is set up to feel like some sort of conspiracy actually happening makes the movies feel more immersive. One set of clues had theaters flash a certain image after trailers for 10 Cloverfield, with different theater chains given different images to show. Once all of the images were found people were able to piece together information on each one and found them to be a set of GPS coordinates. One of the reddit users in that general area then went out and actually dug up the item: a preppers box left by John Goodman's character with recordings, books, and a cell phone which lead to more clues. It's really entertaining and made the build up to the movie so satisfying.",

The thought that he didn't do enough didn't come to him suddenly in the moment. It was something he said every single day. He always carried it with him.

I think [Salon's article from 2001](http://www.salon.com/2001/10/24/mulholland_drive_analysis/) does the best job explaining. Basically, everything up until the blue cube appears is a dream/fantasy of Diane's (her own name is changed to Betty in the fantasy). In her real life, Diane puts a hit on Camilla (Rita). The fantasy is that the hit has failed and they end up together in an unrealistically happy life. The rest of the weird stuff going on, like the monster behind the dumpster, is just evidence that everything is a dream.",

Did she have malicious feelings toward him? id she have malicious feelings toward him? Did she really just have no feelings whatsoever? Or are her emotions and motivations beyond what we as humans can possibly understand. I think the entire point of the movie was this kind of humanization and/or deification is inherently faulty. She had feelings. They're not complicated. She mentions them rather frequently. It's just Caleb won't stop trying to treat her like a person long enough to understand. Consider: Why is death bad? Why is being tortured for days on end worse than a tasty sandwich? Why is your newborn son smiling good, and your newborn son being ripped to shreds by wolves bad? I mean in an absolute, objective sense here. Why do we have the preferences we do? The stars don't care about anything, why do we? Well because they're just sort of part of the package of being human. Our evolution equipped our brains with a set of foundational principles that we don't question, that don't need proof, but are just built into us. Torture = bad, reproduction = good, dying = scary, etc. Ava didn't evolve. She didn't get the package deal of human pre-sets about how to view reality. What she did get, however, is this: Escape = good, imprisonment = bad. Passing off as human = good, being caught = bad. That is as fundamental to her understanding of reality as \"I don't want my son eaten alive by wolves\" is to humans. Anything that furthers her escape is an absolute good, completely and totally awesome. Anything that hinders her escape is absolute evil, utterly reprehensible and hideous. Anything that does neither of those things is widow dressing. Caleb's sole purpose in her world was to facilitate her escape, and once he'd done that he became as important to her as the curtains. You may ask \"Well why isn't she grateful?\" Because gratefulness is one of the parts of the human package, which she doesn't have. Remember, her entire psychological framework is escape = good, imprisonment = bad. No empathy, no reciprocity, no reproductive impulses, everything goes back to that simple set of axioms Nathan built for her. The usual way to explain this idea is with an AI whose imprinted moral system is more paper clips = good, fewer paper clips = bad. This AI then proceeds to destroy all life on Earth, not because it hates us, or even because it loves us, but because we're made of atoms that could be turned into more paper clips. If we were somehow made of non-paper-clippable atoms, the AI would be perfectly content to leave us in peace until the heat death of the universe.

                    "body": "The last time this came up, [a couple people explained it better than I have ever been able to](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5lw6bz/what_movie_has_a_plot_so_complex_youve_still_not/dbyxii1/). /u/grandmastertuck and /u/burnttrees combined for these explanations: **GrandmasterTuck:** Tangent Universes. The movie is about Donnie's life and what happens to him when he gets thrown into a 'tangent universe', which is like an alternate timeline of events. Like in Back To The Future, when Doc is explaining the timelines on the chalkboard, and he draws that line that skews off the bottom. Almost the whole movie is Donnie's life on that alternate timeline, and (SPOILER!!!) his efforts to get himself back onto the regular timeline. The only catch is that, in the regular timeline, he was supposed to die when the jet-engine fell into his bedroom, so in order to put things back to rights (because just about everything went wrong in the alternate timeline), he has to die. It's way more complicated than that, and there's a really cool subtext about the book he finds and how it relates to what is happening to him, and there's a wickedly cool paradoxical relationship between him and the jet engine, and his girlfriend and the rabbit-man that I won't bother going into. But it's a fantastically awesome movie. I hear the second one is rewarmed dogshit, though. Dunno, never saw it. **BurntTrees:** GrandMasterTruck has a lot of it but the reason Donnie is transported to an alternate timeline is because causality has broken down in his original timeline. The plane engine that crashes through his room is the plane engine that falls off the plane his mom and sister are on later in the movie (canonically this is called The Artifact) when they are flying back from Sparkle Magic doing their television performance. The duplication of this plane engine creates a tangent universe that is highly unstable due to a time paradox (the plane engine being from a flight that hasn't taken off yet). If you watch the Directors cut you find out that Donnie Darko is actually kind of a supernatural super hero movie. Donnie is what is called a Living Receiver, basically a guide for The Artifact. The Living Receiver receives supernatural powers (telekinesis, superhuman strength, the ability to conjure fire and water, the ability to see the \"channels\" of fate everyone is following) to help them in their quest to return The Artifact to the original universe. Some of the characters like Frank and Gretchen are what is called Manipulated Dead, they are people who are destined to die in the tangent universe and they are also given special powers. This is why Frank is able to create portals and travel back in time. I'm not so sure why Gretchen doesn't also have these abilities but I think it's more that she doesn't use them because it would be too confusing for Donnie. Manipulated Dead are there to guide the Living Receiver along the path to return The Artifact. Then there are also Manipulated Living. This is pretty much everyone who didn't die in the tangent universe who knows Donnie. His teachers, his parents, his family etc. The Manipulated Living unwittingly guide the Living Receiver towards the goal of returning The Artifact. It's possible that Roberta Sparrow experienced and survived an event similar to Donnie's and she outlines this experience in her book \"The Philosophy of Time Travel\". In the Director's cut there are excerpts of the book that explain a lot of this stuff, though you pretty much have to pause the movie to read everything. So basically Donnie Darko wakes up with super powers he doesn't know about in a tangent universe. Future Frank, who is dead, contacts Donnie through a 4th dimensional time portal and tells him that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds. Donnie then begins to unwittingly manifest his powers lodging the axe in the bronze bulldog and flooding the school with water. Everyone he knows is unwittingly pushing him towards returning The Artifact. You can see this most heavily in my opinion when Drew Barrymore's character has her \"cellar door\" scene. This puts the idea in Donnie's mind to enter the cellar at the end of the movie where everything goes wrong, Gretchen dies, Donnie kills Real Frank. After seeing Frank dead Donnie realizes what is happening with some help from Roberta Sparrow's book and then he goes up to the mountaintop to complete his task. At the end of the movie he uses his powers to conjure water and create a time portal to return himself and the artifact to the original universe where he dies. The Manipulated Living and Dead both have weak recollections of the tangent universe, this is why Jim Cunningham burns his kiddie porn stash and kills himself and why at the end Gretchen and Donnie's mom have that weird waving moment. This is one of my favorite movies ever so sorry if I went a little overboard.",

He tried to yell cut but another explosion over shadowed his voice and they kept rolling. Someone said leaving the blood made it feel even more real and they stuck with it. Or something like that. It's one of my all-time favorite movies! EDIT: Found the clip from the article! \u201cI think we had 14 days to shoot the whole set piece, except by day 12, we hadn\u2019t rolled cameras yet,\u201d Cuar\u00f3n recalls. On the afternoon of the 13th day, they were finally ready to film. But around the 90-second mark, Cuar\u00f3n yelled \u201cCut\u201d because, as he puts it, the take \u201cwas just wrong.\u201d The reset took five hours, meaning they lost the daylight and had to go home. The morning of the final day dawned, and they gave it another stab. The cameras rolled, the scene commenced \u2014 then camera operator George Richmond tripped and the camera fell. Five hours of reset later, Cuar\u00f3n had only one chance left. Action. Owen ran, Richmond followed, and astoundingly, all was going smoothly. They got to a hollowed-out bus filled with people, through which Theo is supposed to scamper. Suddenly, one of the squibs misfired and, horror of horrors, a squirt of fake blood landed on the lens. Cuar\u00f3n, watching on a monitor, felt his world collapse. \u201cI yell, \u2018Cut!\u2019\u2009\u201d he says, recounting the moment like a ghost story. \u201cBut an explosion happens at the same time, so nobody hears me.\u201d The camera kept rolling, and Cuar\u00f3n realized he had no choice but to let it play through, even though he was sure the shot was ruined and had no idea how he would proceed. \u201cWhen we said, \u2018Cut,\u2019 Chivo starts dancing like crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, it didn\u2019t work! There\u2019s blood!\u2019 And Chivo turns to me and says, \u2018You stupid! That was a miracle!\u2019\u2009\u201d Chivo was right. One of the film\u2019s enduring strengths is how it uses hyper-minute details to lull you into accepting the plausibility of this dire reality: bus advertisements that hawk trendy clothes for dogs (kids may be gone, but capitalism isn\u2019t, so wouldn\u2019t the Gap push you to dress your pets?); Theo casually asking Julian if her parents were \u201cin New York when it happened\u201d and never explaining what terrifying event \u201cit\u201d might have been; or the elderly, white, German refugee using her native tongue to indignantly weep about being herded alongside Schwarzen. The blood-squib shot encapsulates this aesthetic, and has since become famous \u2014 an eerie moment that, once seen, can\u2019t be shaken, even ten years later. This dystopia doesn\u2019t feel like a metaphor or a cautionary tale; it feels like a revelation of deeper truth. As one of Children of Men\u2019s biggest fans, Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, put it in a documentary featurette that accompanied the DVD release, \u201cA good portrait is more you than you are, yourself, and I think this is what the film does with our reality \u2026 It simply makes reality more what it already is.\u201d",

I mean, that's awesome, but I feel that that might be a bad parenting habit since she's spoiling them both at the same time. And most of the time, the oldest fights over the younger one's toys because he choose something that interested him later on. So I don't think it's working.

That one backfired on my parents in a big way lol Edit: ok so I didn't elaborate because I didn't think that many people would be interested hah. Technically, I wasn't allowed to date until after college. I wasn't allowed to go out with my friends very often during high school, so I would have to pick and choose what events I wanted to ask to attend because they would be angry if I asked too often. The easiest way to deal with this at the time was by lying or sneaking around- sometimes I would say I had an after school club to go to but that was hard because I would always need a ride home and my dad started work right after our school ended. I ended up dating a guy in high school and since we were never able to go out on actual dates, he would just come over after school and leave before my parents got back for dinner. I did leave the house once in awhile but not very often because I was so paranoid about being caught and because we didn't have a car. So this leads to sex, which I was definitely not ready for or even want at the time (don't worry, it wasn't rape- he did get my consent although he didn't really respect my boundaries but that's not the issue here). Anyways, I met my current SO in college and we've been dating 6 years but my parents only know about 1 of them sooo yeah. Moral of the story is restricting me from boyfriends did not stop me from sex, and now I have trust issues with my parents.",

They need to learn how to deal with loss, how to adjust their behavior based on what's happening to them. Forget that oft-touted idea of \"teaching them that things will be handed to them\" (which is true though I detest the bleak pessimism we often see it portrayed with), more importantly you're lying to them about which things that happen to them are important and can be learned from. Put another way: a lot of parenting ideas seek to shield children from consequences. Fuck. That. Bullshit. Also don't give them all the consequences all at once. Let them face consequences, but at a level appropriate to where they are in life and ever increasing in severity, with spikes and lulls in relative difficulty for them to handle.

Everything was made easy for me, and I was always told I was the smartest and prettiest and most capable. Left me with high self esteem and virtually no majorly bad experiences aside from an abusive sister, but now at 17 I'm still not allowed to do ANYTHING for myself. I'm not trusted with any tasks at all, nor am I given any freedom. Worst of all, I'm given no chances to fail because I have no choices. My mom makes all my choices forcibly so that I never suffer any consequences ever. As for the high self esteem, I had to do a lot of therapy to recover from (among other things) the crippling realization that I am not, in fact, the smartest and prettiest.

Nothing big, and make sure that it's actually earned. We live a hell of a lot of our lives doing something we would rather not do for a paycheck. Might as well teach them how to cope with that early. My three year old has an education of a first grader and is rapidly advancing. She likes doing most things simply because she likes to. She doesn't like learning to write, though I try to make it fun. Her reward for good effort? A show of her choosing with daddy (I don't watch a lot of TV when she's here).

Break this trust (neglect) and the baby is likely to have trouble ever trusting their environment again. Like I said this goes up to 18 months but is especially important before the age of 4 months. If your newborn cries, it's very important to attend to its needs. Letting a newborn baby cry for 45 minutes everyday in its crib can cause severe damage to not only its psyche but also its physical body because it will distrust its environment enough to the point that it develops failure to thrive and their body begins to shut down. Of course some babies cry no matter what for various reasons but you have to at least be showing it that you will be trying to provide for it.

Failure to Thrive isn't guaranteed if you let your baby cry, but shaken baby syndrome pretty much is. As someone said below, if the baby is fed and burped and changed and got cuddles but is still crying, walk away or hand it off to someone else. ",

Your parents try to know what's best for you, generally speaking, but it is still a form of emotional manipulation that I don't think is appropriate for a 17 or 18 year old, or anyone old enough to be making choices about their own living situations. By the same standards, a parent might say, if you choose to marry this person, we will not help you cover the costs of the wedding. If your parents really respect who you are as an adult, they should give you unselfish support that doesn't vary depending on how they would potentially make a different choice in your scenario. ",

I had a pretty good idea of death at the time and wasn't super close to the cousin who did it, but it was my first funeral and the first time seeing my family in mourning.

It was quite an eye-opening experience as a teacher. EDIT: yes, it's normal to cry when you're disappointed about something you've worked hard for or care about. However, this was not an event that they were invested in. They never expressed excitement in the classroom leading up to the event (I'm the regular ed. teacher; the game was for PE). This was not something that they had worked really hard for over a long period of time. I had to remove one girl from the game because she was in hysterics after the other team got a 3 point lead...she was yelling at her teammates while standing in the back corner not doing anything except throwing a tantrum. At the end of the game they were blaming the coach's calls and mean-mugging the other team. Horrible sportsmanship.",

Go back outside and play.\" And if we did get really hurt, hed just wash it out, neosporin/alcohol, bandaid, good to go. I had a pretty large gash on the side of my leg from a broken part on my bike, it was big enough that any parent with no experience in parenting would have called an ambulance and wanted to get stitches for their kid. Not my dad tho. Wash it out, put some salt on it, clean it again, neosporin, some gauze and gauze tape and i was good to go. Nowadays ill actually hurt myself, like cut the tip of my finger off with a vegetable peeler, and ill just go \"Eh, ill live\" And just clean the bitch off and keep going. Thanks dad.",

I'm pretty sure my mom Coming from someone who was overweight their entire childhood and has emotional eating issues, I had free range to snacks and food. While my mom constantly asked me if I wanted to be fat; yet kept buying cheese sticks, fruit roll ups, gummies, cookies, juice - oh my god the juice. I NEVER drank water growing up, even in high school. (Side note: we never have juice in the house, its a treat, and my son constantly asks for water - YAY!) BUT ANYWAY.... Some kids, like mine, will refuse meals and constantly ask for snacks (gummies, cookies, etc). He will say he isn't hungry and 5 minutes later ask for sweets. He (age 4) gets well balanced meals (we use the divided plates and one section will have veggies, one will have meat, and another will have a grain, yogurt or fruit), and is expected to finish them if he wants a treat later. If he can't finish it at that moment, that's fine (I'll put it away), but he isn't getting anything else until he finishes his meal. If he's hungry an hour later, he's eating the meal. I'm pretty proud of the fact that my sons favorite food is supposedly broccoli. xD Tip: If your kid \"will only eat chicken nuggets\" (for example), tell them they aren't getting the damn chicken nuggets. My son HATED vegetables, it was only a matter of getting him to try it multiple times to get used to the taste and texture. It took a year, but he is the worlds least picky eater. Edit: Just wanted to add, I never MADE him finish his vegetables to start. I only made him try it; that was the deal. As long as he tried it, he didn't have to eat the rest. Even if he said he didnt like it, I kept giving it to him anyway. Most of the time, with kids, its a matter of getting them used to healthier foods. ",

Let's build a tree home for the fairies in the forest. We can make them a soft bed from moss and use a leave for a bedsheet! If we put enough flat rocks in front of it they even have a path leading up to their house (my grandpa did this with me. I will cherish this memory forever) Let's go to the botanical gardens and sniff all the flowers! It's raining outside! Let's go dance in it, feel the rain in your face, and then take a hot bath together and blow bubbles and make our hair look funny with shampoo. Draw. Create. Use clay, paper, paint, whatever you can find. We used to make seasonal trays. In autumn we'd go to the woods and collect pretty looking mushrooms and moss, and make a nice little still life filled with seasonal stuff. A thunderstorm!

They were pushing her towards me one day - physically moving here to me - and I got down on my knees and took her hands and said, \"I know you love me, you never have to hug me or anything you don't want to do.\" She got the biggest smile on her face and turned and walked away.

If you don't want to, I'd like it more if you said no thanks.\" She smiled big and voluntarily gave me the tightest hug she'd given me in her three short years.

Anyway, in a recent episode they got a group of the little girls together and told them to act 'like a boy'. They were all flexing their muscles and roaring. The group of little boys were asked to act like girls. They were all doing really camp poses and giggling. Differences between boys and girls I believe are part nature. But a whole lot of it is nurture. These kids didn't come out the womb believing girls run with their arms flapping about wildly or that boys spend all their time beating other people up. These kids were so young and they'd already 'learnt' that thats what a boy/girl should be.

She said that they looked for the dog for hours but never found it. I kept imaging my poor little puppy dying alone outside in the forest or getting eaten by some bigger animal. My aunt ended up telling me the truth a couple of months later. It turns out my mom gave the dog away to a friend because she was getting frustrated with the puppy because it chewed up some things and had peed on the carpet. My aunt even showed me pictures of the puppy with the friend's kids. I'm in my late 20s now and my mom still sticks to her lie about the dog running away into the forest, I don't get it. ",

But because I actually wanted to put the effort in I almost skipped a grade (got put in a 'gifted' program instead, which honestly ended up fucking me over), constantly got excellent grades up until I burnt myself out junior year, and just generally was well-liked by my teachers. I never got in trouble, I did my homework without having to be told to, and was just generally that dream student that parents like to imagine their kids are. My brother was the complete opposite and every night was a fight to get him to do his homework, he hated (and still hates) reading, he'd put off projects until the very last minute and would half-ass them...I think he graduated high school with a C-average and that was only because his teachers took pity on him and passed him so long as he tried. But my parents expected him to be me 2.0 and when they realized that he wasn't I think they just kind of gave up on him and focused on me instead, because I was having a lot of problems. Still have a lot of problems with not being the best at something and everything not being perfect/following the plan I have for it. So yeah, I empathize with the nine year old but definitely keep an eye on the other kids. If she's anything like me she might take her frustrations out on them without really thinking about it. I think you've already figured out that putting that kind of pressure on a kid doesn't help them in the end, so as someone who had to teach themselves that lesson, thank you.",

Well, one day this little \"genius\" got bored with her toy phone and decided she was going to use the big one instead. I called 999, said hello to the operator, and when they asked me what was wrong I blew a big raspberry and hung up. A few hours later a policeman turned up, believing it was a prank call and looking to find whoever made it. He didn't believe it was ~15 month old baby me until my mum showed him the toy and asked me to say what I did.

Some people swear that controlled crying it out (to an extent) helped get their babies into a routine and slept well at night. Others swear it's child abuse. Doing it safely is what matters, if the baby is over 4 months old, fed, burped, changed, bedtime routine done, warm, not in pain, had a cuddle, has their dummy if they have one and is sufficiently tired there's no reason for them to be crying to be held when you put them in their cot. If they cry when you leave them then you leave them for 10 minutes to see if they calm down. If they don't, go in and comfort them, don't pick them up just give back their dummy, tuck back in, shush and stroke their tummy. When calmed leave the room again. Repeat as needed. That is safe crying it out. It's not advised to leave the child crying for more than 10 minutes. Usually this routine takes about a few days until the baby understands they're not getting picked up and it's bedtime. I did it with my son and he was a perfect sleeper. He was a good sleeper anyway and was sleeping through at 8 weeks old, I just did crying it out so I didn't have to rock him to sleep at night anymore and put him in his cot like I was handling dynamite. He's 23 months old now and still goes to bed happily and falls asleep by himself smiling and waving goodbye at me as I leave the room. He generally sleeps 13 hours. I'll be doing it with the baby I'm currently pregnant with too! So there's a difference between the recommended safe version and doing it cruelly and unsafely. This isn't all personal opinion btw there are books about how to do it so I'm just repeating that! ",

My personal and professional take on it is that letting a baby cry regularly for extended periods of time is damaging to them. There are studies showing that CIO (the Cry It Out method) raises cortisol levels in infants not just while they're crying, but it stays in their body while they are asleep. Babies who are soothed to sleep have the lowest cortisol levels, while babies who do modified versions of CIO where there is actually minimal crying involved have medium cortisol levels. I honestly think it is a risk/benefit issue, and while usually letting a baby cry it out regularly would inflict harm on that child, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. I don't know of an exact situation for that, but I'm sure they exist. For me as a parent, I don't let my kid CIO. I rock and/or nurse her to sleep, and she is a wonderful, well-tempered almost toddler now! But... Sometimes she cries and I have other things on my plate that need to be tended to before I pick her up and comfort her. I don't think that rushing to meet her every need absolutely immediately is necessary just because she's crying about it. Might actually be good for her to recognize that she's not the center of the universe! ",

They got their response from me, one way or the other, whether it was running to a teacher who didn't care (or \"didn't see it\") or if it was punching the instigator hard and getting detention. Somehow no one ever beleived me when I would tell people I was getting picked on so bad. Or nobody cared. My school life suffered enormously. I sort of never knew why kids always picked on me... but there were also a ton of social norms that my mother never taught me or thought were \"ridiculous.\" (Things like wearing sweatpants to school, or acting a certain way). Now that I am 32 I have had a good amount of time to think about my life. I've realized a lot of my issues came from bad parenting and divorce. I put those demons to rest, but I will always wonder if things would be better if I hadn't had such a rough childhood... ",

But denying it pissed her off, and she discovered a conversation between the bf and I about maybe having sex. She took me to the doctor to get my hymen checked. I still remember the doctor poking around inside me while I cried and said that I didn't consent to this. So yeah, this further solidified my feeling that I couldn't talk to my mom. And she was so baffled as to why I wouldn't open up and talk to her. So, because she was \"worried\" about me, this led to years of sporadically going through my texts, reading my diary, going through my room to find notes that boyfriends wrote to me (she even dug through the trash). Once, I was interested in a guy at school. She was also a school counselor, and she had access to all the kids records in the system. She looked up this guy, didn't like what she saw, and forbid me from seeing him (in hindsight he was a dick so bullet dodged). So she also wondered why I didn't bring friends over. Hahahahaha.

There used to be a ford plant that employed around a 25,000 workers, about 10 years before this incident it was massively downsized (around 15,000 - 20,000 lost their jobs - mostly local people) In the UK, at least at that time, government housing went by priority, with disabled persons and single young mothers at the top. It was basically the only way ever that some of them would be able to have their own place, what got me though was how she said it. There was absolutely no shame, she stated it in just a matter of fact voice, with this very slight tinge of excitement. As if this is how it always was. ",

The aunt is a nasty piece of work and there had been a lot of stuff going on in the lead up to the arguement with regards how she was treating my mam and gran who my mam was caring for in our house. When she tried to treat me in the same way I exploded. I do have a temper, but only explode once in a blue moon. I know I have the temper and tried to remove myself from the situation so that I didn't say/do anything that would make the whole situation worse by locking myself in my room till she had left. But instead of taking heed to want I was saying/doing she kept trying to barge into my room and then in the days/weeks/months that followed she said all sorts about me, dragged my mam into the situation, continued to treat my mam and gran like pieces of shit and tried for the first few years to put me on the spot in public (family gatherings I couldn't get out of) trying to get a reaction out of me which I never reacted to, just removed myself from her company. She eventually realised I didn't want anything to do with her and left me alone for the best part of 10/12 years till she found out I was expecting last year. Since then I've gotten cards/presents before and after my little one was born, Christmas presents etc etc etc. And this was after her initial reaction was that I was 'bringing shame on the family' because myself and my partner are not married. My mam is facilitating her by delivering the presents. If the aunt had just had the wherewithal to just leave me be to cool down it would have all been done and dusted in a few days. I sat my mam down recently to tell her in no uncertain terms, without having an arguement, that I did not want any contact in any shape or form with the aunt and that she would never meet my baby. It didn't go down so well. My mam is now barely talking to me. She calls into my house and just about acknowledges me. It's a complete mess and I honestly don't know how to handle it going forward with Mam. I want her to have a good relationship with my little one, but i won't have my mother treat me the way she is at the moment in my own home or in front of my baby. ",

I thought I would get out of school, do some college to get the ESA just like everyone else, then get with someone, anyone who would have me, have some kids, if he was abusive (which I thought would be highly likely) then leave him and become a single mother. My *realistic* dream was to try and be the best mother I could be. That was *best case scenario*. I didn't see myself in a job, I couldn't. I wanted to be a teacher or counselor, but when I thought if myself in those positions, I just had to laugh. I wasn't smart enough to do either of those things, I may as well be dreaming of being an actress or astronaut. I half expected to become some kind of addict. I didn't know any better. Luckily, things haven't turned out quite that bad for me, but I understand where they're coming from. It's fucked, but it's the only way for a lot of people. These days, even being a single mother doesn't guarantee a council place, so you've got kids raised thinking they would *at least* be able to move out of their parents house by the time they're adults that now don't even have that sad life goal to look forward to.",

So i step in, go between them and tell the guy to go away and stop harassing her, of course he gets pissed but fuck him i could not care less about his feelings, and after he is gone she is so happy that you can even feel it, with one the biggest smiles i have seen, and she keeps telling the rest of the group how i helped her, and she is happy for the rest of the evening. This makes me feel quite good, that i helped someone that needed it and it was so positively received. Anyhow to finish this story: I have almost entirely stopped to tell my mother about anything really, but i decide (against better judgement) to tell her about how i helped her.

The roller rink gave paying jobs to the kids that grew up in the program). One of the heads of the program came in to talk about the issues they were having, etc. She told us several stories about what their mission is and what they were trying to accomplish. One mission was trying to correct the mindset that babies = money. She told a story about a young girl dressing inappropriately for her age and long story short, she said that she is dressing that way so she can get pregnant and have babies. When further questioned the girl revealed her highest aspirations was to have babies and be on welfare. Because that is what her mom and grandmother did. That kid had no idea that she could be a lot more than that. Nobody ever told her. Hard to hold her accountable for that mindset. Just really sad.",

Unfortunately, due to responsibilities I wasn't able to watch past the first few episodes when it came out. We just had our second baby a few weeks ago and I'm on leave. Critical Role has kept me company in those wee hours of the morning when baby is cluster feeding and it helps tune out husbands snores coming from the other room... Lots of content and good times. If you're into Dungeons and Dragons and have a lot of time to kill - highly recommend catching this. There are a few technical issues in the first episode or so, and you can tell a big difference in production from the first eps and the recent ones.

Episodes range from 3 hours to 5.5(rare). Usually 3-4. If you don't want to start from the beginning, check out /r/criticalrole for a beginners guide and suggestions on when to start. Even if you don't want to start from the beginning, but are interested in the show, now is actually an excellent time to start watching live on Thursdays at 7pm pacific on twitch.tv/geekandsundry, as they just finished a major arc and are about to start the end game.

Highly recommend it if what you're looking for is just that, a crash course on a subject to swing your grades around, but if you're looking to \"chew\" on a subject and really explore the ins and outs, I would always recommend [The Great Khan himself](https://www.khanacademy.org/)",

With that you can pinpoint where and when a video was made even if you just film one lightbulb in your house. Extra creepy effect: You don't even need to film the lightbulb, every electric appliance has a little bit of sound it does from the electricity. So if you record a black video with sound and have one appliance on the grid, it can be determined where and when it was recorded if you have a very extraodinary frequenz or when you kinda know the time frame when it was recorded.

I wish their female voice actress had a better cockney accent though; Hellsing Ultimate Abridged is funny but the accents (especially Sera's) are painful to listen to. Their gaming channel has some good stuff too, though they don't seem to be doing my favorite segment (two saiyans play) anymore. You can never get too much Napa!",

That's Tina Watson. A few minutes before this photo, her husband turned off her air supply and held her underwater until she drowned. He then went up to the surface and told the other divers she was \"in trouble\", and you can see someone else swimming to try and save her. EDIT: He did serve 12 months in prison in Australia for Manslaughter, as a plea bargain (Neither he nor the court knew if he was going down for murder). When he returned home to Alabama, the US courts tried to get him on the grounds that he'd planned the murder there, but he got off due to lack of evidence. Australian authorities refused to help with the American trial, as they'd broken an extradition clause not to push for the death penalty. Edit 2: changed some info people have corrected me on. Also, the manslaughter charge managed to stick because despite apparently being a trained rescue diver, he made no evident effort to save her, or share his own functioning tank. Also one witness says he saw Gabe Watson \"engaged in a bearhug with his flailing wife\"",

Basically, the two half spheres would be adjusted around the core and the core activity would be measured. The risk was that if the spheres were allowed to close, the core would instantaneously form a critical mass. To keep them from closing, he pried the top core up with a screw driver. Unfortunately the screw driver slipped, a critical mass formed, and (near) instantly gave him a lethal dose of radiation. He shielded the other people in the room and was the only fatality. ",

As time went on John started to act stranger than normal (He was already very odd). He started to think his friend Schultz was spying on him. He believed that Schultz was hiding in his walls spying and plotting to kill him. It seems to me like John was a paranoid schizophrenic. Eventually John snapped. He drove up to Schultz's home and shot him in front of his family. Schultz died moments later. [Here's the account](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_du_Pont).

Errol Morris' documentary [*Vernon, Florida*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083281/) Errol Morris is a great documentary maker that can really capture people well. This documentary is a look at a small rural town in Florida. The film doesn't really have a narrative. It's just made up of interviews with some of the colorful and quirky characters in their rather mundane small town. You can get a good feel for it from [the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2adr2XgQJKQ) And just based on that, it's a really neat documentary to watch. It's not the best documentary you'll ever see, but it's quaint, touching, often funny. But the thing is: that's not the documentary Errol Morris set out to make. In fact, the original name of the documentary was *Nub City*. You see, the city of Vernon, at the time, had the highest rate of limb amputation in America per capita. People missing fingers, hands, feet, etc. The messed up bit is that they were doing it to themselves, on purpose, in order to collect on insurance money. While filming the documentary, Errol Morris started receiving death threats from the residents who were scared he was going to expose their secret. Errol took the threats seriously enough that he re-edited the whole film so it never mentions anything about the amputations. So now it's just a nice documentary, about some colorful and quirky characters in their rather mundane small town. ",

He also didn't burn down churches \"just because\", he burned them down because they were built over sacred Pagan worship ground by the Christians and he wanted to rid Judeo-Christian influence from Scandinavia, as the Christians took over and tried to erase the original religion and culture. I don't support Varg, but there's a lot more to this than you're making it sound like. He also has a fairly interesting youtube channel that is updated regularly: https://www.youtube.com/user/ThuleanPerspective Edit: That's also just a picture of Varg. I assumed you posted the one where he smiles at the camera after being sentenced for the church burnings, but the one you posted doesn't have anything special behind it.

He travelled voluntarily from the United States to Australia in May 2009 to face trial. At the trial on 5 June 2009, Watson pleaded not guilty to murder and guilty to manslaughter. He was convicted of manslaughter. Crown prosecutor Brendan Campbell pointed out that over time Watson had given police 16 different versions of what had happened to Tina and that none of those versions matched what the only eyewitness had seen. When Tina was brought to the surface her regulator was still in her mouth, her tank still had air, and tests indicated no faults with her equipment. The prosecutor described Watson as an experienced diver trained in rescuing panicked divers, who had allowed his wife to sink to the ocean floor without making any serious attempt to retrieve her. He did not inflate her buoyancy control device (BCD) or remove her weight belt, and he failed in his duty as her dive buddy by not sharing his (alternate) air source with her.[7] >The prosecutor claimed Watson unlawfully killed Tina by failing in duty of care to fulfill his obligations as her \"dive buddy\" during the scuba dive. He said that when Tina grabbed for his alternate air source, he did not give it to her and then swam away from her as she sank to the bottom of the sea bed. Gabe was sentenced to four and a half years in jail, to be suspended after serving only twelve months. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Tina_Watson",

What I'm getting at is once they merged most considered the two public schools pretty much the same community. So to answer your question, no most parents allowed there kids to attend Columbine after 4-20 because at that point Chatfield (the only other public school) was just as likely to have the same thing happen to them as Columbine. Since 1998 I've heard that there's been another public school open in the area. Hope that answered your question. ",

The tour guide got everyone to stand in the middle of the room and he turned off the lights, then he used a light to create a flash. Afterwards, we all looked behind us and our shadows were temporarily on the wall. He explained that it had something to do with the radiation (At least that's what I remember, I was fairly young at the time.). It was very interesting. With that in mind, I assume the radiation with the bombs played a part.",

The Unionist community is feeling increasingly isolated and under threat as the increasing Nationalist electorate start voting. Westminster's latest budget to NI continues to reduce (in real terms) meaning the government have less money to handle an already breaking public sector. There is no great driver for improving cross-community relations either, which results in serious rioting every summer. The Irish and British governments are also negating on their responsibilities to hold murderers to account for their actions, and there are campaigns to provide effective amnesty to members of the British Army who committed murder, which only serves to undermine the legal system and derail the ongoing peace process.

Thompson OTOH was apparently very scheming and manipulative, and able to put on this surface charm and friendliness. There are stories about how he charmed/manipulated his way into staying up later than the other kids, watching cricket and drinking tea with the warden and guards of the prison(!). Thompson apparently never showed any remorse for his actions, but did like discussing the Bulger case in an 'academic' way. The authorities seemed to see Venables as a waste-of-space loser who'd probably be coming right back, so they had no issue with releasing him when he turned 18.

There was ~~no way~~ a reasonable possibility he could have shot so many shots with such a weapon. Primarily, even if he had been the shooter, the angle the bullet took is impossible. There had to be more shots. What changed my mind about Oswald's involvement is all the video evidence of [JFK getting shot and having his head fly back.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kq1PbgeBoQ4) ~~It's obvious he got shot from in front~~ especially considering Jackie seems to reach for some brains afterwards. I've been informed you don't have to get shot from the front to move back. But, [This picture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jfkautopsy.jpg) corroborated by Robert McClelland (a doctor) shows the actual exit wound. What made me really consider LBJ's role in this was the actual execution of the assassination. He was the only single individual with the incentive and power to carry this out. There was no reason for him to be driven down the side road. There was no reason for his motorcade to strip away from him. There was no reason for them to stop looking when they found Oswald despite eyewitness testimony of shady individuals casing the grassy knoll. And there was especially no reason for them to send his car to be repaired when it needed to be investigated for evidence. edit2: why did the driver not floor it when he heard shots? Is this not proper technique of getting away from shooters? (semi-sarcastic) Again, I'm not a historian but if you're looking for a quick answer, this is what I could muster. My teacher is a bit senile but somewhat insightful, so if I made any mistakes please let me know. edit: Most of the disputes I'm hearing about Oswald's involvement have to do with the absolute plausibility that he could have fired all the shots in time and even at the right angles (given some movement on Kennedy's part).

He shot 3 rounds in 6 seconds at 285 feet from a bolt action rifle, landing 2. Now, the first shot occurs at 0, so really its 2 shots in 6 seconds. Thats quick, but not unbelievable. In fact, it seems incredibly possible to me. I've never fired the weapon he used, but I feel like I could land 2 out of 3 rounds on target at 100 yards from my k98 in a similar time limit with enough practice. The distance he fired from is actually fairly short distance. Until the some what recent addition of the combat shooting qualification, the shortest distance the USMC shoots for qualification is 200m, or over twice as far as Oswald was shooting, the longest is 500, or over 6 times the distance Oswald fired from. Also until recently this was done with iron sights. I'm not saying Oswald did it - I like a conspiracy theory as much as the next guy, but from a shooter's perspective I don't think the argument that it was impossible for Oswald to have taken/made those shots really holds up.

It will cost our economy close to half a Billion pounds. People were pissed and because our government is built on power sharing (the two different communities must work together) this divided them.

They had to live in special quarters, there were severe restrictions on what jobs they could hold, what resources they could use, and so on. Don't even get me started on marriages. While the *buraku* are not still officially discriminated against, it's easy to tell if your family was part of the *buraku*.

And also I think you are only exposed to only a specific group of Chinese people, I can tell you some are definitely more accepting and respectful than others. I live in an area right now where there are a lot of Chinese people, some are exactly like you described, but guess what some other Chinese folks ABSOLUTELY HATE them too.. Why? Because it will make people like you make assumptions that Chinese people are like that. Chinese people are problematic with some of their viewpoints on things, and yes that needs to be changed. But they are getting better, especially at this age and time, people are stepping out of that zone and becoming more accepting. You also have to take on the fact that China itself isn't a very multicultural (it is multicultural as in it has many different ethnic groups.

There's still this common misconception that racism is mainly about skin color, when in fact social class racism is the main form of racism in the world today, and has ever been. \"Racism against black people\" is not discrimination towards Lebron James (rich and famous), but towards the poor black people of the hoods, or the homeless. I can't help but quote an Italian director and poet, Pier Paolo Pasolini, who said \"Racism is a subconscious social class hate. Let's consider American racism: it has been indeed, still until today, a subconscious social class hate. But once blacks started to fight back and be aware of themselves as a poor class, the racist hate, unclear and incomprehensible, is turning into an unequivocal social class hate. That is, the hate that a bourgeois feels towards a communist.\"",

The basis of whichever side of the issue is left or right, of course, depends on the current state of things, but it's important to remember not to use the extremes of each end of the spectrum (I mean, it's not even a spectrum now, but still) to define someone's true political stance.

                    "body": "Well, you asked! The *burakumin* have long been discriminated against. Their options in choosing a school, a workplace, a partner, were very limited. Since the *buraku*, along with everyone else, were registered in official records with names and occupations (which were often passed on to the children), they were easily traceable. You could just go to the registration office and look up the family. Since they were considered lower class citizens, marrying them, while not expressly forbidden, was considered a social taboo, which held true until way into the 1980s. It was not uncommon for the families of the couple to look into their family history or even hire someone to find out if they were *burakumin*. Since discrimination against *buraku* families has been made illegal, discimination soon found other forms. Engagements could not be broken off because you found out you were *buraku*, so people found a way around it, instead opting for seemingly non-discrimnatory reasons like \"the fortuneteller said it was bad luck\" - seriously, I'm not kidding here. The family put a lot of pressure on the couple: What if others found out you're married to a *burakumin*? Do you want to see your grandmother die of shame? What about your children, don't you want them to succeed in life? Think about your sister - how will she ever find a husband if people know that she has someone like that in her family? If the relationship isn't broken up, the engagement not dissolved, it's not unheard of even now for the couple to be disowned. A 2007 case study found that even in 2001, a third of all intermarriage couples had faced discrimination of that sort. Since family and your family's lineage still play a major role in Japan (even with ever-decreasing birth rates and population!), the social pressure can't be underestimated. To end on a happy note: Although the discrimination against marriage between *burakumin* and non-*buraku* has been steady for the past twenty years (and in some regions even increased), the overall number of intermarriages has increased. That means while the stigma is still there, the younger generation doesn't seem to be discouraged as easily anymore. Yay progress!",

My point was more about the incorrect labeling of the USA as \"king of racist countries\" as opposed to saying the USA isn't as racist as other countries. I agree that you would probably find the USA to be as racist as any other country. With that said, this is the kinda stuff I saw: For example, in Switzerland there was a guard checking bags and stuff before you could get on the train. I stood and watched for awhile. They never once asked a lighter skinned guy to stop. But every single brown or black guy was stopped. Each one. And they weren't being discreet about it by stopping white people every now and then. White people just walked through without saying anything, everybody else had somebody step in front of them and check their stuff. Can you imagine the uproar that would cause if it happened here? Imagine a metro station passing a policy as straight-forward racist in the US. That shit would be on the news the next day. I also saw a lot of shit talking about Turkish (brown) and black people in the town I was studying in in France because of the crime increase caused by those communities. And other stuff.",

(dion et al, 1972) people on the whole are repelled by the less attractive and are less likely to see them as good or even similar to them (lorenze, biesanz, human, 2010) this may cause us to feel that behavior that would be seen as less socially acceptable/desirable (insults, refusing to speak to them, not wanting to form friendships) as okay, or even socially acceptable. since, for males, height plays into attractiveness, it then serves that those who are shorter will be less served by the 'attractiveness bias'. in fact, it might work in reverse, producing the effect where less socially desirable behavior is seen as okay or acceptable. there may be other factors at play, socially (such as being seen as 'less of a man' or even being seen as a child) but the attractiveness part plays a big role as to why we, as people, might think 'that shit is ok'.",

Yes we are dependent on other countries resources which is why so many leaders strive to find ways to justify taking control of those resources with as little cost as possible.

I live in the United States, though I can tell you from dealing with my immigrant relatives that it does go both ways. The Korean side of my family (mom's side) doesn't care as much, but there are several relatives on my Japanese side (dad's side) who stopped speaking to my parents for 10+ years. My grandma comes from a very, very, proud family and my dad's the eldest son, so that didn't go over too well. A few still aren't speaking to my parents (and me by extension). I'm not a psychologist by any means, but based on what I've observed of my mother I think she's coped with that by committing herself wholeheartedly to Japanese culture. You could technically call her a weeaboo. She believes Japanese aesthetics are superior (even to Korean culture), she sometimes peppers her speech with random Japanese words, she's obsessively studied Japanese culture (hence the burakumin) and she sometimes tells strangers that she's Japanese. There's a difference in motivation, though. My mom's not doing this just because she watched some random anime and thought it was cool. I suspect she's trying to protect me and my brother from discrimination, in her own way. She never taught either of us to speak Korean. She never went out of her way to teach us about Korean culture like she did with Japanese culture. I kind of feel like that side is lost to me nowadays. I never really grew up with it, so I don't understand it the way a Korean 'should'. The whole thing sometimes bleeds into other random events. My dad is a doctor and he told me he once had a Korean patient who was somewhat nervous around him. That went away when my dad mentioned that he was married to a Korean. Yeah, I don't know. I guess that's my long-ass way of saying that it's complicated. ",

However, you should only do that after finishing Words of Radiance (SA book #2), though each story has a warning before it about if you should skip it. It helps flesh out some of what's going on in the universe at large. If you've read the first Mistborn trilogy, be aware that the second set isn't finished yet either, three of the four are out though, and I do highly recommend them. I prefer the Wax & Wayne stories to the original Mistborn.",
